5000003~Mahi-Mahi in Tomato Olive Sauce~881~36~20~0~35~3902~3~The Sicilian-style tomato sauce has tons of Mediterranean flavor, thanks to the orange peel, olives, and oregano.

5019323~Peach Mustard~195~50~48~0~0~975~0~Where a chutney and mustard sauce overlap. Choose a very ripe– even bruised–peach for easy peeling.
5000015~Raw Cream of Spinach Soup~1605~78~24~23~133~3253~20~This uncooked soup isn't for the timid — raw garlic, ginger, and shallot impart strong flavors. Unless you can get freshly made vegetable juice from your local juice bar, you will need an electric juicer to make the tomato or carrot juice.
5000016~Sweet Buttermilk Spoon Breads~147~1~1~12~10~624~370~Classic spoon bread is a savory pudding served as a side dish. In this dessert version, the slightly sweetened batter is baked in individual ramekins, then topped with strawberry preserves.
5006976~Crisp Braised Pork Shoulder~492~22~12~1~46~4957~0~Pork all over Denmark is hauntingly tender. Ruggiero was particularly taken with the pork belly she tasted at the restaurant Gammel Mønt—crisp, but succulent and rich. To re-create these qualities, Ruggiero devised a version that requires minimal effort but promises stunning results: Pork shoulder is braised first, until it's super tender, and then flash-seared for a golden crust. The aroma alone will convince you that this unorthodox technique is entirely worthwhile.
5000018~Mozzarella-Topped Peppers with Tomatoes and Garlic~690~67~48~15~36~869~47~Highly recommended!

5000021~"""Fried"" Chicken"~4317~535~90~133~23~8867~50~"Nashville: Try the ""fried"" chicken, y'all. Southern hospitality wouldn't be quite so hospitable without corn bread, collard greens, and, of course, fried chicken. If you haven't already guessed that grease is what's so ""finger-lickin' good,"" we'll let you in on a secret: You can spend nearly half a day's calories on one thigh of this Southern-fried favorite. So make our baked version instead."
5000022~Fish Fillets in Parchment with Asparagus and Orange~590~58~31~14~34~2379~91~In this delicately flavored main course, the asparagus steams along with the fish in individual paper packets.

5011051~Moroccan-Style Preserved Lemons~380~37~30~0~27~14~0~Though you can certainly buy preserved lemons, we prefer the rich, clean taste of homemade. This technique, adapted from Paula Wolfert's, brings a multidimensional freshness and a wonderfully distinct pungency to the lemons, which are as much a revelation in salads, soups, or even cocktails as they are alongside the grilled fish. There's no need to rinse them first, but do discard the pulp — only the rind is eaten with the grilled sardines.
5000032~Roasted Sweet-Potato Spears with Bacon Vinaigrette~3634~410~223~84~180~5981~271~Don't be surprised if these spears prove even more popular than the classic mash—they brown up beautifully, and it's hard to resist the siren call of bacon.

5008887~Pastry Twists with Spiced Sugar-Honey Glaze~3562~713~441~35~59~1232~45~"Donatella still remembers the lure of these addictive sweets. ""I always got in trouble with my aunt because I would sneak into the kitchen and steal them,"" she says. Frying the dough in extra-virgin olive oil adds an authentic flavor. You'll need about five cups of oil for frying."
5019948~Sauteed Broccoli Rabe~984~61~17~35~61~4181~171~Highly recommended!
5000038~Grouper with Tomato and Basil~486~75~16~16~27~695~0~Highly recommended!
5017100~Better-Than-Pita Grill Bread~1114~200~4~88~55~2458~0~Cooking these flatbreads in a grill pan gives them a smoky flavor. They can be served with hummus or the Lebanese Lamb and Bean Stew. Don't expect a pocket — they are like rustic tortillas.

The baked halibut here has become a weeknight staple."""
5000042~Honey Rye~374~76~37~14~1~478~36~"For inspiration, co-owner Eyal Raziel looked to his native Israel, where honey liqueur is popular. ""The Bärenjäger balances the kick of the rye,"" he says."
5005128~Purple-Potato and Crab Gratin~2958~272~9~135~159~1846~956~This recipe originally accompanied Poached Halibut with Black Truffles and Purple-Potato and Crab Gratin .
5000044~Grilled Beef, Jícama, and Apple Salad~1110~69~50~151~26~2249~124~This Thai-inspired salad has that classic tart-sweet-spicy flavor balance that really gets your taste buds dancing. The cool, crunchy herb-laced salad is the yin to the yang of the rich tender beef. Whats more, the food processor does most of the work.
5019938~Pickled Red Onions~30~8~3~0~0~484~0~Vegan (when made with agave nectar or sugar)

5000052~Braised Chicken With Artichokes and Olives~1724~150~39~34~70~2601~98~I didn't think it was possible to love artichokes more than I already did until I lived in Italy. There they harvest artichokes in both spring and fall, and that abundance graces their cuisine. Artichokes also enhance their health, as they stimulate the gallbladder to produce bile, which escorts toxins out of the body and also helps break down fats in the diet. Here, artichoke hearts are combined with chicken, chickpeas, and olives to create a rich, nourishing stew, seasoned with a potpourri of heady and healthful spices, including turmeric, cumin, coriander, and mint. For a wonderful pairing, serve it over Brown Rice Pilaf with Saffron and Ginger .
5000053~Pancetta Roast Chicken with Walnut Stuffing~3235~213~55~71~228~6535~316~Topping the chicken with pancetta slices before roasting adds a rich flavor.

5000055~Collard-and-Prosciutto Chicken Roulades Over Watercress Salad~2300~354~252~64~81~2973~151~This is a simple recipe that tends to impress. These elegant roulades are surprisingly easy to make and will get you a standing ovation at the dinner table. Take a bow, as you're giving everyone a nice dose of brain protection thanks to the vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin K, fiber, and phytonutrients found in the watercress and collards. If you can't locate fresh figs, swap in two thinly sliced ripe pears, and feel free to swap out the collards for kale.
5000056~Veal Burgers Stuffed with Mozzarella Cheese~2614~105~10~185~294~5495~531~Highly recommended!

5000061~Romaine, Grilled Avocado, and Smoky Corn Salad with Chipotle-Caesar Dressing~1659~17~7~14~166~1866~59~Grilled avocado is one of those things that sound faintly ridiculous until you try it—then you wonder why you never had it before.
5016676~Southwest Corn Bread Stuffing with Corn and Green Chilies~1797~153~68~31~131~4816~686~For best results, make this stuffing with day-old Buttermilk Corn Bread.
5000063~Colin Perry’s Sorghum and Apple Sticky Pudding~4246~526~385~54~217~5107~679~Eastern Kentucky–born and –raised chef Colin Perry plies his art now in Montreal at Dinette Triple Crown. The food there taps into traditions of both the far north and the high country South, as in this delectably oh-so-sticky pudding. “I tend to use a lot of maple syrup in my cooking up here, because it’s so delicious and so accessible. But sometimes the taste of sorghum is the only taste that will do,” he says. Really fresh leaf lard has become more available in recent years from artisan butchers and specialty stores. If you can’t get real lard, then use butter. Shortening and grocery-store lard aren’t worth it.
5000064~Mixed Berry Pavlovas~4598~678~632~12~236~881~793~Highly recommended!
5000065~Orange-Almond Cake with Chocolate Icing~4201~236~181~77~331~3196~904~An impressive-looking layer cake with great flavor—and lots of room for candles.

5000069~Tomato-Infused Bulgur Pilaf with Fresh Basil~390~52~10~0~13~1962~0~When an abundance of fresh vine-ripened tomatoes piles high on my mother's kitchen counter in Thessa-loniki, she cooks up a simple pot of juicy bulgur with the fruit. This classic pairing is born out of necessity in the heat of summer in many parts of the Mediterranean. It nicely accompanies lamb chops, flank steak, chicken breast, or grilled shrimp.

5000079~Anadama Rolls with Mixed Seeds~5617~938~61~181~119~7265~109~Anadama bread recipes, which date back to pre-Revolutionary New England, all call for molasses and cornmeal for substantial- and delicious- results. This contemporary rendition is no exception.
5000080~Braised Chicken and Rice with Orange, Saffron, Almond, and Pistachio Syrup~3254~369~69~91~177~681~89~Here is a jewel of an Afghani dish. Unusual and exotic, it is one I cook regularly, sometimes with shoulder of lamb instead of chicken thighs. I serve it with slow-cooked spinach, finished with leeks and a minuscule amount of rhubarb. This may sound strange, but the rhubarb is sweetened by the leeks and it really does work.
5000081~Horseradish Dill Potato Salad~605~96~12~11~21~764~32~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5000082~Chicken in Green Pumpkin-Seed Sauce~1471~106~15~16~105~5641~62~Pipián Verde con Pollo
5000083~Jeweled Rice~4408~722~298~67~140~1527~63~Yes, making this rice is a time commitment and a labor of love. But the ingredients aren't difficult to find, and the finished dish is stunning.
5000084~Braised Brisket with Bourbon-Peach Glaze~3199~361~222~137~142~67225~240~No one will fault you for seasoning brisket with salt and pepper, braising it in beer, and calling it a day. But follow chef Lee's method—which calls for a bath of stout, bourbon, and soy sauce; a glaze made with peach jam; and a side of easy homemade pickles if you'd like—and you're on the path to savory-and-sweet nirvana.
5000085~Grilled Pork Chops with Classic Barbecue Sauce~1501~208~153~22~68~3398~45~Constant basting with this lively sauce ensures moist chops and plenty of flavor. Warm potato salad with tarragon and white wine is the natural accompaniment.
5000086~Bacon Crackers~1154~107~30~32~67~1819~136~"These dangerously addictive little bites fueled countless 1950s and '60s bridge parties from Greenwood Mississippi, to Greenville, South Carolina, before being rescued from recipe-box oblivion by modern Southern cooks like Martha Hall Foose. And thank goodness. Magic happens when a cracker slowly sops up the fat from smoky, crisping bacon; it transforms into something more akin to piecrust. Unadorned, bacon crackers are pure pork perfection. The addition of a tine bundle of rosemary needles makes for a fancified version, while topping the ""belt"" of bacon with a bit of brown sugar adds a hint of sweet to the smoke."
5000087~Roast Chicken With Sorghum and Squash~1918~235~197~20~97~1554~251~Sorghum is a gluten-free grain, with a texture similar to wheat berries, barley, and millet—so feel free to substitute those for this chicken recipe instead.

5000091~Salmon with Chili-Mango Salsa~420~36~1~0~27~0~0~In Tucson, chef-owner Janos Wilder offers cumin-flavored rice pilaf and grilled zucchini with the fish. Flan is a good finale.
5000092~Turkey and Pinto Bean Chili~1133~126~38~91~22~9011~313~Just like some Mexican moles, this chili has a bit of chocolate in it. Serve sour cream and shredded sharp cheddar cheese alongside.

5000103~Short Rib Pot Pie~4340~414~29~554~408~11234~1388~Shortening is the secret to extra-flaky pie crust, but nothing compares to the flavor of butter. Use both, as in this super-luxe beef pie, and you're golden.
5000104~Stout Floats~599~114~102~2~17~1167~0~"On a recent visit to London, Knauer overheard a local in a pub ordering a ""Guinness and Black"" — which turned out to be the famous Irish stout plus a shot of blackberry brandy. That combination is also the genius behind these floats; the brandy's luscious fruitiness bridges the gap between the sweet ice cream and bitter beer."
5000105~Apricot-Pistachio Muffins Baked on the Grill~4247~675~262~107~169~3394~559~If you don't want to heat up your house with the oven, you can bake any muffins on the grill but the lightly smoky flavor that the grill imparts is especially nice with corn-based ones. Because keeping the grill at a steady temperature can be tricky, the baking time can vary, so keep an eye on the muffins. For the best muffins, be sure that the entire pan is not set over direct heat (otherwise, the bottoms will burn).
5015208~Garlic Bruschetta~876~33~0~0~82~0~0~Highly recommended!
5000107~Asian Noodles with Barbecued Duck Confit~1412~272~53~40~11~6010~11~Glazed with a mix of hoisin, lime juice, and Sriracha sauce, duck confit happily travels from France to China. This exciting dish blends the fresh flavors of carrots, long beans, and herbs with slithery rice noodles and tender duck, its skin crisped under the broiler. When roasting the duck, be careful not to overcook it—you dont want it to dry out and become stringy.

5016899~Cherry Lime Virgin Rickeys~84~22~19~0~0~0~0~Kids will need no explanation: They will marvel at these red-and-green-striped drinks that they swirl with a straw. And for grown-ups who may want to get in on the fun, you can make another batch—a shot of gin makes a pleasant, and civilized, addition.
5011839~Buttermilk-Spinach Spaetzle~3142~547~23~89~46~2741~134~Little dumplings that are served in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Alsace, spaetzle are usually made by pushing the batter through a strainer into boiling water.

5000177~Cassata Cake~10087~1054~902~87~693~2136~2985~I grew up outside Cleveland, Ohio, and the cassata is the cake of my childhood. This regional specialty is a great example of how recipes take on local styles over time. Some food historians believe the cassata has its roots in fourteenth-century Arab culture. In Sicily, the long-ago homeland of the immigrants who first brought it to America, the cassata often contains candied citrus fruits, citrus liqueurs, and a glazing of chocolate or almond marzipan.
5000178~Baked Beans with Slab Bacon and Breadcrumbs~4033~401~36~167~177~10697~354~These aren't sticky-sweet brown sugar baked beans. Think of them like the top crust of a good cassoulet.
5000179~Grilled Corn with Lime-Cilantro Butter~928~16~9~2~93~1173~253~Sweet summer corn is the best. You can make variations of the cilantro butter with different herbs and use lemon juice. If the corn isn't too sweet, add a little bit of maple syrup to the butter.

You can also pile the grilled vegetables onto crusty French bread that's been slathered in creamy chevre. Or make hors d'oeuvres by topping Crostini with slices of grilled vegetable and some crumbled chevre. The vegetables can be grilled up to 1 hour in advance; assemble just before serving.
5000184~Roasted Bell Peppers with Basil and Balsamic Vinegar~900~78~4~8~62~1411~0~This simple starter is delicious served with crusty Italian bread.

5000186~Potato Gratin with Goat Cheese~1105~77~17~27~80~2822~79~Bucheron is an aged goat cheese—sharp but gooey and oozy around the edge. If using fresh goat cheese, it will soften not melt.

5000188~Pork Roast Braised with Milk and Fresh Herbs (Maiale al Latte )~1433~127~82~23~78~3770~85~Simmering a pork roast with milk and a generous handful of herbs results in very tender meat with rich, silky juices. Many Italians will leave the milk curds that form alongside the meat where they are, but Ferrigno strains them out for a more refined sauce.

Almonds make a good substitute for the hazelnuts."

5000193~Chili Meatballs in Black Bean and Tomato Sauce~2432~362~71~66~66~2456~37~This Mexican take on meatballs is one of my family favorites—my boys really love the crispy chorizo sprinkled over the top! It's so rich and warming, but we love it all year round.

5000198~Sangria IV~2394~482~447~12~51~1302~0~Málaga Tapas & Bar gets its name from a city on Spain's southern coast — and from the authentic savory appetizers and snacks it serves with wine and other drinks, in the Andalusian tapas tradition. Málaga, located in Austin's trendy Warehouse District, is a favorite among the after-work and late-night crowds. This recipe for sangria comes from the restaurant's bar manager and resident wine expert, Merrill Frank.

5000215~Roasted Quail with Wild Mushrooms~1695~6~7~66~126~2673~219~"This recipe is a wonderful way to celebrate the spoils of the Southern hunt, though it is just as delicious when made with farm-raised quail. If quail livers aren't included with the quail, chicken livers would be a good substitute. The size of a quail makes each bird a perfect individual portion for a dinner party. To make the stuffing, we've used another reward of the ""hunt"": wild mushrooms. When we forage in the woods near Summerland Farm, the mushrooms we most often find are chanterelles and hen-of-the-woods, especially prolific during a moist season. If you are foraging, be absolutely sure you know what you are looking for, as poisonous varieties can sometimes look dangerously similar to edible ones. To be on the safe side, visit a gourmet market or natural foods grocery store for a nice choice of mushrooms. We serve the quail on a bed of Wilted Autumn Greens."
5000216~Mocha Brownies~3394~377~269~42~192~256~634~Because these brownies are thinner than most, they bake quickly.

5000224~Chicken, Corn, and Noodle Soup with Saffron~1955~323~56~46~51~7453~155~This is a lighter, first-course version of a classic Pennsylvania main-course soup. Saffron was initially a Colonial rich man's spice, and it retained a certain panache even for the Pennsylvania Dutch in Philadelphia, who grew their own.
5000225~D.i.y. Drinks Bar~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5000226~Yellow Squash and Bell Pepper Torte~1890~175~41~56~102~3578~105~What you have here—sun-gold bands of decoratively arranged vegetables and clear, immediate flavors enriched with Parmigiano-Reggiano—is an absolute stunner. And, because the torte must be made ahead and weighted (to release excess liquid), it's ideal for entertaining. Serve it with anything grilled (fish, chicken, or lamb, for instance) and your guests will be over the moon.
5000227~Black Bean and Vegetable Wraps~2883~449~77~68~84~5600~104~"""At the Manhattan law office where I'm a legal secretary, it seems as though the phones are always ringing,"" writes Lisa Caiazzo of Franklin Square, New York. ""And if it isn't the phones that have me occupied, then there are lots of documents that need my attention. By the time I get home from the city, I usually have only about 45 minutes to put together dinner for my husband, Angelo, and myself. Still, that's enough time to make something filling and delicious, like a salad and a hearty pasta or soup. My best cooking, though, is done on Sundays during the fall and winter, when I become a football widow. An afternoon of cooking can be very therapeutic after a busy week."""
5000228~Fennel-Rubbed Pork Roast~118~0~0~0~13~0~0~As the pork cooks, the fat will gradually render, basting the roast.
5000230~Beef Stroganoff with Tomatoes~1301~103~14~34~79~9972~85~"Shullie Neumark of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, writes: ""I like cooking but I'm a little bit impatient, which is why I make dishes that can be done ahead of time — and quickly. I hate being rushed before meals, especially when guests are on their way over. Those guests are usually good friends or members of our large family. Often I'll prepare some of the Russian and Lithuanian recipes passed down from my relatives."""
5019832~Mashed Potato and Cauliflower Gratin~5046~739~166~133~153~21610~406~We love mashed potatoes in every way possible, but we're extremely partial to this incarnation paired with cauliflower. Since cheese is a natural with both potatoes and cauliflower, incorporating a little Fontina and parmesan into the purée adds a nutty goodness, without overpowering it with richness.

5000233~Honey-Cinnamon Ice Cream~3192~330~317~24~204~1308~689~The first time my parents came to Rialto, site of my first pastry chef gig, my mom laughed out loud when she saw the dessert menu. Every dessert featured ice cream, and one dessert had two. My dad and I are both complete ice creamaholics, and once I was in a position to make my own ice creams, they showed up everywhere I could put them! I made fruit ice creams, nut ice creams, spiced ice creams. You name the ingredient and I made it into an ice cream. This was one of my favorites. Originally it was a honey-vanilla ice cream, but this variation popped up one day when my vanilla supplier missed a shipment. Needing to make a quick ice cream base for that evening's service and stuck without vanilla beans, I turned to the spice larder, selected a few cinnamon sticks, and a new flavor was born. I like the way the warm cinnamon flavor melds with the natural earthiness and roundness of the honey. An added plus is that honey is a sweetener that lends itself to extra-creamy ice creams, which you'll notice immediately when you taste this one after churning.

5000246~Herb-Roasted Turkey~1495~113~99~13~107~20157~223~This is a good option for cold-weather Thanksgivings eaten under threatening skies, since the combination of herbs and citrus provides a house-filling aroma that speaks to sunniness.

5000256~Polenta With Mushrooms~1682~111~18~68~105~4501~163~This easy slurry method takes polenta into weekday fare. And this recipe shows how to make a deeply flavored mushroom sauce with the simple addition of dried porcini. Both techniques are in my go-to repertoire.
5000257~Potato Pancakes with Chick-Pea Flour, Cilantro and Cumin~1763~274~25~62~58~5962~371~Even though they are most often associated with the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, potato pancakes have a year-round appeal.

5000270~Pickled Feta and Cerignola Olives with Strawberries~5071~315~149~14~391~10526~0~Briny feta is pickled, then tossed with plump olives and strawberries for a bright, juicy salad. Since the feta needs five days to cure in the fridge, this is a great make-ahead dish. Use Greek feta if you want neat cubes; Bulgarian feta is divine, but it needs to be handled carefully as it's very soft and crumbly. Whip up this recipe for a picnic, or serve it after a day on the beach when salt and sun are still on everyone's mind. Glasses of Prosecco or Saison are a perfect accompaniment.
5000271~Breakfast Bowl With Quinoa and Berries~1541~186~91~42~71~672~0~Breakfast bowls are the new green juice: they've become an in-demand menu item for the post-yoga, post-spin class set, despite some eyebrow raising prices for what boils down to a pretty simple breakfast. Why spend all of that money on something you can easily make at home? This hearty, gluten-free bowl takes just minutes to throw together and is absolutely delicious.
5000272~Pot Roast with Orange and Dates~2634~527~439~20~41~2081~0~This recipe calls for two small roasts instead of one big one. They are easier to cook, and make for prettier slices.
5000273~Cheese Puffs Gougères~2380~339~31~41~83~1848~582~Based on the classic pâté à choux or cream puff pastry from my culinary school days, this elegant and easy appetizer can be made ahead. It can be prepared dairy-free, too, but egg substitutes won't work as the eggs are necessary to help create the structure of these bite-size treats.

5000278~Pinhead Oat-Crusted Catfish, Roasted Cauliflower and Mustard Greens, and Lemon Cream~2164~83~21~51~179~2712~518~Pinhead oats, which are similar to steel-cut oats but contain some oats that are ground finer, like flour, make a foolproof crunchy-crisp gluten-free crust for pan-fried fish. You can exchange the catfish for just about any common white fish here—use a lower heat level under the pan and a longer cooking time for thicker fillets. Some good options include U.S. farmed tilapia, ocean perch, Pacific halibut, and line-caught Atlantic cod. Wild salmon would also be delicious—just be sure to avoid overcooking it.

5000296~Cucumber-Dill Soup with Scallions~3799~78~128~104~41~391~19~This is one of my favorite soups. It has to be served really cold so that you can appreciate the buttermilk and yogurt tang and the sharpness they add to the cucumbers.

5002764~Butterflied Turkey with Fennel, Sausage, and Ricotta Stuffing~4451~226~53~316~247~18580~719~"The technique: When it comes to poultry, butterflying means removing the backbone and flattening the bird like a book. This is easy enough to do with a chicken, but we suggest asking your butcher to butterfly the turkey.
The payoff: A flattened turkey cooks more evenly and quickly than a regular bird. Tucking the stuffing under the skin ensures that the meat will be moist and delicious.

The dish improves if prepared ahead of time and reheated. The pork freezes very well, but the pineapple does not, so add the fruit just before serving. You must use fresh pineapple, as the acidity of the fresh fruit provides the balance needed in the sauce. Serve this dish with white rice."

5000346~Galician Pie~2246~390~6~180~102~1107~434~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are from 1080 Recipes by Simone and Inés Ortega.
5000347~Angry Lobster with Lemon Rice and Crispy Basil~14350~1167~115~116~1251~20219~125~This is probably the most requested dish at my restaurant, davidburke & donatella. You can, of course, adjust the heat in this dish to your own palate. I really like it to have a powerful note. It is another terrific dish for entertaining as the rice, basil, and tomatoes can all be made in advance. The rice can be kept warm over hot water or it can be reheated in a microwave. The lobster can be cut up in advance, and then all that is left to do is to put it all together, which should take no more than twenty minutes.
5000348~Strawberry Banana Smoothie~1284~337~87~22~10~635~0~Highly recommended!
5000349~Chocolate Pecan Layer Cake~7853~734~572~83~533~2247~891~A bourbon-laced cream filling and rich chocolate glaze turn the classic layer cake into something really special.

5012778~Champagne Vinaigrette~1259~62~25~0~110~1693~0~Highly recommended!
5000353~Onion Soup with Apple Cider~2914~543~451~3~88~3579~126~Heat leftover apple cider with a cinnamon stick on the stove top. It makes a great warm drink—and instant aromatherapy.
5000354~Curry-Lime Yogurt~250~41~29~16~0~607~18~Lime juice and curry powder enliven this simple yogurt dipping sauce. It's so quick and easy that you can make it while the pancakes are cooking. For best results, use full-fat yogurt. In a pinch, low-fat will do, but do not use nonfat.
5000355~Ramp and Buttermilk Biscuits with Cracked Coriander~1984~273~31~61~7~2716~4~The easiest way to crack the coriander seeds is to put them in a heavy-duty plastic bag and pass over them with a rolling pin. For a great sandwich, split a biscuit and fill it with sliced ham or smoked salmon.
5010433~Cassoulet~4739~354~69~248~224~19020~804~In this version of cassoulet, garlic-crumb topping is served on the side. Rather than acting as a thickener, the crumbs give our brothy version of the dish a crisp layer of texture.
5013991~Vanilla Mousse Meringues and Fresh Berries~3737~449~409~33~211~1066~673~Highly recommended!
5000358~Broccoli Rabe and Butternut Squash~576~27~11~14~45~1547~52~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5010718~Duck Confit~9320~46~6~14~971~17544~1088~Once esteemed as a preservation method, cooking and keeping duck in its rendered fat results in meltingly tender, moist, and extremely flavorful meat which can be used in a variety of simple preparations. Sear the duck legs in a hot skillet or shred the meat and add it to salads, or, perhaps best of all, make duck rillettes. Just remember the duck must be salted a day before you plan to cook it.
5000360~Egg Noodle, Chard, and Fontina Torte~2334~182~40~117~127~6889~655~A savory take on noodle kugel, this beautiful dish is creamy on the inside with a golden-crisp crust. Using thin egg fettuccine rather than traditional short, wide egg noodles adds elegance.
5016806~Toasted Baguette Crumbs~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~As a crisp topping for pasta or steamed vegetables (Garlic Baguette Crumbs) or as a crucial ingredient (in the Apple Prune Brown Betty), these are worlds apart from store-bought bread crumbs.
5000362~Mussels and Fries with Mustard Mayonnaise~2201~52~5~128~142~5322~646~While there's no substitute for eating a bowl of mussels on France's Atlantic coast, you'll be surprised at how easy it is to re-create this briny, aromatic dish at home.
5000521~Spiced Pita Toasts~946~0~0~0~110~1938~0~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5019036~Court Bouillon~545~92~10~16~8~3235~0~Highly recommended!
5000366~Savory Parmesan Pain Perdu with Poached Eggs and Greens~1503~112~27~68~64~5142~547~We're not dismissing the sweeter side of pain perdu (French toast), but custardy, golden bread just as easily goes savory. Here, its baked into a puffy, cheesy base for poached eggs and a salad.
5000367~Choucroute Garnie~9120~717~162~462~479~49738~1628~Choucroute — the pickled cabbage that is a cornerstone of Alsatian cuisine — is similar to sauerkraut. One key difference is that choucroute is always cooked in wine. Here, sauerkraut is combined with smoked ham hocks, sausages and potatoes.
5000368~Fried Eggplant, Tomato, and Cucumber Salad~1394~68~24~23~116~1912~30~Eggplant is like a sponge. Salting it draws out moisture and firms up the flesh, and deep-frying ensures it cooks evenly until creamy throughout. Worth your time.
5000369~Dried-Fruit Strudel with Apricot Preserves~1802~283~183~14~66~335~0~"Diane Ives of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, writes: ""As an epidemiologist who works with older people, I make diet and exercise an important part of my life. I try to eat as healthfully as I can during the workweek, and I stay away from processed foods — I'd rather have something simple and fresh anyway. But on the weekends, when my husband and I entertain, I love to splurge and make desserts. Since they are the first thing people remember about a great dinner, they are definitely worth the effort. The dried-fruit strudel here is a family recipe I learned from my grandfather, but I've simplified it so it can be made quickly with purchased pie crust."""
5000370~Pear and Hazelnut Crumb Pie~4050~686~386~50~127~95~157~Highly recommended!
5000371~Green Mountain Maple Barbecued Chicken~457~46~45~18~22~329~89~Traditional accompaniments like coleslaw, baked beans and brown bread are ideal with the Vermont-style chicken; afterward, enjoy gingersnap cookies crumbled over vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt.
5000372~Savory Yogurt Cooler~1120~191~126~36~19~1040~37~(Coconut and Mint Lassi)Lassi is a refreshing yogurt drink that is very popular in its native India and Pakistan.
5019150~Veal Stock~1992~61~20~138~118~6468~421~This recipe makes quite a bit of stock, but that's a blessing since it must cook for 24 hours. Freeze it in 1-quart containers (or smaller) so it's handy for later use. If you are pressed for time, by all means begin with a prepared version of demiglace (available in most grocery stores or online, such as Demi-Glace Gold brand), and dilute it with 2 to 3 parts water—this is a fine and practical option to making your own veal stock.
5013943~Orange Dust~291~71~67~0~2~1~0~This recipe is an accompaniment for Shrimp with Orange Dust .
5004765~Café Azul's Pastry Dough~1500~492~0~228~0~6011~4~This recipe makes much more dough than is needed for the Mushroom and Butternut Squash Empanadas with Smoked Chile and Tomatillo Sauce , but it freezes beautifully, wrapped well in plastic wrap and sealed in a plastic freezer bag. (Defrost the dough in the refrigerator for 6 to 8 hours before using.) At Café Azul, Archibald also uses this pastry for pies and tarts.
5000376~Roasted Tomato Sauce~309~58~10~6~4~1289~8~Highly recommended!
5000377~Dry-Rubbed Flank Steak with Grilled Corn Salsa~1471~81~59~121~70~6954~306~This spicy and sweet powerhouse seasoning blend packs layers of flavor onto grilled flank steak.
5000378~Classic Coconut Cake~7018~838~514~87~286~1708~767~Room temperature ingredients make all the difference in this cake. You can get more loft from non-chilled egg whites, and room-temperature butter is easier to cream (beat together) with sugar than the straight- from-the-fridge stuff. The fluffy egg whites and properly creamed butter and sugar mean tender, light cake. And room-temp butter and cream cheese will translate to creamy, smooth frosting instead of a sticky mess filled with lumps.
5000379~Tony's Negronis~267~45~40~1~0~17~0~These cocktails are as much fun to drink as they are to say. Tony Oltranti adds freshly squeezed orange juice to a traditional Italian aperitif and serves it straight up in a chilled Martini glass. Salute!
5000380~Icy Lemon-Mint Parfaits~1762~307~295~0~70~68~296~Highly recommended!
5000381~Grilled Curried Mangoes with Ginger Ice Milk~355~61~59~0~13~927~0~Curry powder is a natural with mangoes, since they are both important foods in India. Grilling the mangoes softens them slightly and intensifies their sweetness. The curry powder helps to bring out their heady perfume. This is the perfect dessert for those times when you already have the outdoor grill fired up for cooking your main course.
5000382~Paris's Crimson Champagne Cocktail~1388~269~265~1~10~133~0~Highly recommended!
5000383~Raspberry Hazelnut Brownies~3092~414~284~65~161~1574~604~Raspberries taste wonderful with chocolate, and so do hazelnuts. All three flavors unite compatibly in this cake-like brownie.
5000384~Banana Rum Puffs~4574~692~268~203~228~2014~574~To bake these puffs all at once, you will need 6 mini-muffin pans, each containing twelve 1 3/4- by 1-inch cups. However, you could also make them in batches using fewer pans.
5013733~Whipped Potatoes with Herbs~3408~537~100~50~104~15891~253~Highly recommended!

re cheese, apple and fresh greens."""
5000388~Tomato and Tomatillo Gazpacho~661~84~30~5~31~1215~0~Celebrate the last of the hot weather with a spirited, chunky gazpacho in the Mexican mode. Tomatoes give the soup their characteristic rich, rounded flavor, and tomatillos—an Aztec and Mayan staple—lend fruity tartness and great body.

5000390~Brussels Sprouts and Pearl Onions in Horseradish Cream~1221~71~16~24~93~448~329~Highly recommended!
5011226~Parsnip Gnocchi~2873~426~75~48~102~2490~623~These unusual and delicious gnocchi are baked rather than boiled. To make them, the chef at L'Etoile in Madison, Wisconsin, mixes mashed parsnips with a classic French dough, known as choux paste, made of eggs, butter and flour.
5015509~Toffee Sauce~949~118~118~0~58~29~180~Editor's note: Use this sauce to make Suzanne Goin's Sticky Toffee Pudding with Blood Orange, Tangerine, and Whipped Crème Fraîche .
5000393~Zucchini Potato Tortilla~9790~1051~341~126~552~34695~769~In this Spanish-style frittata, the potatoes and zucchini are characteristically creamy and filling. The dish is also a host's friend, since it tastes just right at room temperature.
5000394~Spaghetti and Swiss Chard With Garlic Chips~4050~611~108~78~150~5424~45~Executive food editor Kemp Minifie brought the idea for this restorative pasta from her own home. Everyone in the test kitchen loved the briny intensity of feta and olives offset by sweet currants and slightly bitter chard. The garlic doesnt stay crisp for long, so be sure to serve immediately.
5000395~Swordfish Tacos~256~3~3~0~27~16~0~Besides the tacos, try the Pico de Gallo on scrambled eggs, grilled chicken or instead of sour cream on a baked potato.
5000396~Chocolate Pecan Cake~5038~674~551~87~274~2191~265~A chocolaty version of a rich French gâteau called, aptly, a financier, this cake shows how ground nuts, melted chocolate, butter, and beaten egg whites can result in a deceptively light texture. An elegant dessert, it needs nothing more than a dusting of confectioners' sugar to finish it off.
5000397~Kimchi-Style Sautéed Cabbage~695~81~31~6~33~2016~10~A nice alternative to its fermented cousin; put this on pork chops or fish.
5016463~Basic Mashed Potatoes~3675~692~153~72~55~20352~115~Use this recipe to prepare Cabbage and Bacon Mashed Potatoes, Chili Mashed Potatoes, and Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes.

5000412~Conference~600~81~40~2~30~925~0~This is a tiki drink disguised as an old-fashioned, so it's no surprise that it comes from Brian Miller, Death & Co's resident scalawag and expert on all things Polynesian. One night a waitress asked Brian to make something stirred and boozy, so he took one of tiki's core principles—blending several base spirits to create a new flavor profile—and applied it to whiskey and brandy. It was another breakthrough moment for the bar, and these days it's not unusual to find two or more base spirits in our drinks.
5000413~Saffron Rouille~2022~22~2~0~223~1746~253~Rich, aromatic rouille is a classic lily-gilding for French fish soups; this one has an extra something special: saffron. Even if you love saffron, though, don't be tempted to add any extra threads. This is just the right amount to really flatter, not dominate, the soup.
5000414~Mango-Lime Ice~1561~402~400~4~0~381~0~Pastry chef Jennifer Jones of Topolobampo in Chicago shared this recipe as part of a Cinco de Mayo feature on Mexican desserts. Jones encourages you to use different fruits in this refreshing dessert, but recommends sticking to ones that are sweet but have acidity. Raspberries are a perfect example.
5000415~Minty, Boozy Chicken~2482~400~181~20~78~3315~125~This is like pouring a cooked mojito over stewed chicken, with the rum, lime, and herbs mingling beautifully with the chicken juices. Serve it with rice and a cold, crispy Alsatian white like a Pinot Blanc.
5000416~Green-Bean and Prosciutto Negimaki~715~20~6~44~49~2063~510~It looks like a Japanese roll—but it's not! Green beans stand in for the traditional scallion; thin slices of prosciutto replace beef.
5019101~Chicken Tikka Masala~2323~88~39~144~148~6339~630~"If there's one dish guaranteed to be on every Indian restaurant menu, it's chicken tikka masala, which is composed of grilled chunks of chicken enveloped in a creamy spiced tomato sauce. What's behind this simple dish's tremendous popularity? ""Tomato sauce has universal appeal. When the dish is eaten with naan bread, it's like an Indian version of pizza!"" exclaims cookbook author and cooking teacher Julie Sahni, one of the most respected authorities on Indian cooking."
5000418~Salmon Fillet with Soy Glaze~229~55~52~6~0~3161~0~The Ginger Fried Rice with Shiitake Mushrooms is a perfect side dish for this salmon.
5019275~Lemon Cornmeal Cake with Lemon Glaze and Crushed-Blueberry Sauce~5142~806~571~69~111~2978~623~This rustic cake gets a zing from a tangy lemon glaze. The sauce dresses up the cake for dessert (or brunch).
5007137~Amaretto Olive Oil Cake~2705~89~7~71~239~1597~8~The concept of ground almonds and extra-virgin olive oil in a cake may sound like a recipe for a lead weight, but this dessert is surprisingly airy and light yet also amazingly moist. And the bonus of a jigger of Amaretto liqueur can only make it better.
5000421~Veal, Mushroom, and Red Pepper Goulash~390~56~8~22~29~1239~49~We like this stew with egg noodles (12 ounces of dried pasta), cooked and tossed with two tablespoons of reduced-fat sour cream and a quarter cup of chopped fresh dill.

5000426~Bittersweet Chocolate-Citrus Tart with Jasmine Whipped Cream~3567~375~170~46~209~643~459~The subtle citrus notes in this dark chocolate tart come from pink grapefruit and blood orange zests.

5019794~Caramelized Nuts~3958~208~92~88~324~592~0~The coating on these nuts is wonderfully delicate, and the method couldn't be simpler.

5000429~White Horseradish Sauce~395~15~7~7~35~713~0~Fresh horseradish can have very intense flavor and heat, which is why we start with a small amount — taste the sauce and add more only if desired.

5000439~Panna Cotta with Crushed Raspberry Sauce~1404~0~0~6~137~8~550~"Panna cotta means ""cooked cream"" in Italian, and, indeed, that is just about all these elegant little desserts consist of. A touch of hazelnut liqueur and a rustic sauce of crushed berries make this version just right for romantic company."
5000440~Grilled Butterflied Leg of Lamb with Lemon, Herbs, and Garlic~821~39~3~0~71~6616~0~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional sitting time.
5000441~Roasted Red Pepper Velvet~540~48~30~13~31~807~61~Nonfat yogurt and low-fat mayonnaise provide a creamy base for this dipping sauce for the artichokes. It's also great with asparagus, as well as with grilled tuna, salmon, chicken or flank steak. Begin making the sauce the day before serving since the yogurt needs to drain overnight.

5000452~Cauliflower and Chickpea Curry~549~48~8~4~32~129~0~This beautifully simple, light curry is closely based on a wonderful recipe from chef Angela Hartnett. It's always preferable to use some carefully selected ground and whole spices in a recipe like this, but if you're in a hurry, use a ready-made curry powder instead of the dry spices.
5000453~Ginger Spice Syrup~44~0~0~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5000454~Dried Fruit Compote with Port, Cinnamon, and Ginger~972~218~218~0~0~0~0~"Carol Gilbert of Saratoga, California, writes: ""I've been working full-time since my daughter was in high school, but it took about ten years to get over the notion that I should be cooking everything — the way my mother did — and climb the corporate ladder. There's simply not enough time. I finally realized I didn't have to make everything from scratch; now I give myself permission to buy a dessert or a salad dressing if I need to."""
5005489~Grilled Chicken with Goat Cheese Stuffing, Peppers, Onions and Two Salsas~1198~115~15~54~56~3078~116~Jalapeño-Cilantro Salsa and Tomato Salsa are colorful accompaniments to this great entrée.

5000457~Drunken Beans~1997~115~12~91~125~44864~261~This dish is an excellent accompaniment to almost any Mexican meal. The beans should be whole, perfectly tender, and swimming in a generous amount of broth.
5000458~Junior's Russian Dressing~1112~52~43~0~94~3848~42~This dressing is served on the side with Junior's Reuben sandwiches. It's so good that you'll find many other foods it matches up perfectly with, like sliced roasted turkey or chicken salad, a cold poached salmon salad, cold roast beef, or a fresh tomato salad.
5000459~Giant Chocolate Candy Bar With Peanuts and Nougat~7923~1025~902~163~385~2972~177~The iconic chocolate bar of peanut-studded caramel and nougat is all about chewiness. Transforming that small bite into a giant layered treat means keeping the same flavors, but whipping up nougat fluffy enough to eat by the forkful with soft peanut-studded caramel.
5000460~Shrimp Salad with Zucchini and Basil~1801~58~34~102~129~2029~924~Use packaged prewashed mixed baby greens to make this salad in practically no time. A chilled Sauvignon Blanc pairs well with the dish's fresh, bright flavors.

5000463~Country Ham and Cheddar Pretzel Bites with Jalapeño Mustard~1942~289~40~137~88~15099~284~"Simultaneously salty, sharp, spicy, and sweet (in other words, completely irresistible), these nuggets are chef Edward Lee's way of saying, ""You can have a casual meal without compromising true culinary endeavor."" The tradition of serving mustard with a soft pretzel is strictly an American one; Lee makes his own honey mustard, jazzing it up with chiles. For sources for country ham and pretzel salt."

5000470~Vegetables Printanier~934~152~40~18~23~1197~63~Highly recommended!
5010434~Cheese- and Shrimp-Stuffed Roasted Poblanos with Red Bell Pepper Sauce~355~17~3~53~7~886~434~Instead of Panela, other soft white Mexican cheeses — such as Oaxaca, or those used for making quesadillas — work well in this recipe. If none is available, substitute Monterey Jack cheese. The stuffed chilies can be assembled one day before baking. What to drink: A Napa or New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc (or any dry but fruity white wine).
5000472~Bulgur Veggie Burgers with Lime Mayonnaise~2782~250~15~60~175~3883~63~Most veggie burgers must have self-esteem issues, since they're always pretending to be something they're not. But these bulgur burgers don't try to hide their meatless nature and instead celebrate their grain-centric origins with wonderful texture and a hint of Middle Eastern spice.
5000473~Asparagus Salad with Sweet Balsamic Vinegar~804~68~13~32~49~997~0~Boiling the vinegar concentrates and sweetens it, so the dressing doesn't require as much oil to balance the acid.
5017459~Corn and Lobster Chowder~5186~693~55~264~158~12975~702~If you can't find fresh lobsters, frozen lobster meat can be used.
5000475~Fruit Salad with Honey-Lime Dressing~3912~993~805~13~0~4727~4~"""I literally didn't know how to boil an egg until I was in my 20's — when I tried to impress a guy by making dinner for him,"" writes Sally Siegel of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""I didn't have much success with the dinner or the guy, but I regrouped and put together a repertoire of fairly elegant dishes I felt confident making. Over the years, my cooking style has become more casual; I make dishes that are not too demanding, but still special for company."""
5005687~Brown Rice Pilaf with Saffron and Ginger~935~175~6~21~21~841~0~Healers have touted saffron's medicinal properties since the days of Hippocrates, and Cleopatra claimed that it was an aphrodisiac. Its scarcity (it takes some four thousand crocus blossoms to create an ounce of saffron) and the belief that it could be used to treat everything from wounds to the plague even caused the Austrians to go to war over the spice during the Dark Ages. This is at least one feudal folk myth that modern science has corroborated. Studies have shown that saffron has outstanding antibacterial and antiviral properties and also aids digestion. People sometimes balk at saffron's cost, but it isn't unreasonable when you consider its potency; this recipe calls for only 1/8 teaspoon, and as you'll see, a little goes a long way. This pilaf is a delightful and gorgeous dish. The rice is sautéed before cooking to avoid that sticky, gummy consistency, and ginger, parsley, and lemon zest add zing.
5000477~Ashkenazic Sour Cream Coffee Cake (Smeteneh Küchen)~5514~853~579~141~250~3505~384~"Coffee cakes rank among the most popular of comfort foods, welcomed at breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, and as the name indicates, coffee breaks. A coffee cake batter is generally more liquid than a quick bread one and contains a bit more sugar, and as a result, the final product is lighter and moister. On the other hand, coffee cakes tend to be less sweet than butter cakes. There are many versions of kuchen, this streusel-topped sour cream type being a very popular one. It is commonly served at the meal following Yom Kippur, or Shavuot, and on Sabbath afternoons or the melaveh malcha (""accompanying the queen"") party following the Sabbath. For the later occasion, spices are added to the batter and topping, reflecting those used during the havdallah ceremony signaling the end of the Sabbath."
5000478~Café Iguana Margarita~574~182~90~3~0~0~0~From the Café Iguana restaurant, in Denver, Colorado.
5000479~Country Pâté (Pâté de Campagne)~3979~95~32~217~304~13764~1099~Serve at room temperature with a sprinkling of salt, cornichons, Dijon, and a baguette.
5000480~Shredded Root Vegetable Pancakes~1615~93~39~29~124~4334~14~These root vegetable pancakes are a gift to eggs everywhere for brunch, served under a little crème fraîche and smoked salmon for a party app, or simply paired with sour cream and applesauce for an ideal sweet-savory combo anytime.
5000481~Braised Veal Breast with Herbs, Pernod, and Tomatoes~1690~100~42~12~48~3749~47~This is great with polenta or egg noodles. To peel the onions like a pro, boil them for one minute; drain, cool, and peel. What to drink: Mas de Guiot 2005 Château Guiot Rosé from France ($10), a vibrantly colored rosé with raspberry aromas and a hint of spice.
5000482~Chocolate Marshmallow Eggs~3131~472~406~51~122~1120~22~With a crisp outer shell of chocolate and a gooey marshmallow interior, these eggs are an Easter-basket favorite. If we have any left after Easter, I like to pop one of them on top of a mug of hot chocolate for a special treat. You can either decorate the eggs with chocolate, or you can simply dip the entire egg in tempered chocolate. If dipping, you will need to temper about 1 pound of chocolate to cover all the eggs. Then, working with 1 egg at a time, place it on a dipping fork, dip the entire egg in the chocolate, and then lift it out, allowing the excess chocolate to drip off. I prefer bittersweet, but milk or white chocolate will also work. You will need plastic or polycarbonate egg molds with each side forming half an egg that, when filled, clip together to make perfectly shaped eggs. They are available at most candy- and cake-supply stores.
5000483~Apple Tarts with Vanilla Ice Cream~653~132~128~0~17~0~47~Easily made with puff pastry, these light, thin apple tarts provide just the right amount of dessert. The skins get added to the syrupy glaze, enhancing the tarts with a bit of sweetness and the faintest blush of pink.
5000484~Beef Tenderloin Steaks Stuffed with Morels~2548~133~48~23~192~9413~330~This elegant dish from Tony's in St. Louis, Missouri, is perfect for a small dinner party. At the restaurant, they serve it with sautéed spinach.
5000485~Sour Cream Cucumbers~586~47~35~8~39~1698~19~Highly recommended!
5000486~Lemon Mint Braised Artichokes~502~104~9~3~0~99~0~As a harbinger of spring, artichokes have a special place on the Passover table and in our hearts. One of Roberts's favorite ways to enjoy them is this elegant Roman preparation. (Rome is home to the oldest Jewish community in the Western worldthe first Jews arrived in 161 b.c.e. as ambassadors from Judah Maccabee in Jerusalem.) The trimmed artichokes are braised in a lemony broth zinging with garlic and mint, which is later reduced to a satiny sauce.
5000487~Grilled Vegetables with Mixed Greens and Blue Cheese Dressing~3491~392~99~67~179~12530~149~As this recipe proves, barbecue isn't just about the meat. Veggies taste even better when they're grilled. Add some crumbled Maytag blue cheese and a bright dressing for a meal that even a carnivore could love.
5000488~Fava Bean, Asparagus, and Arugula Salad with Shaved Pecorino~710~83~11~27~28~1744~0~This salad was inspired by a couple of dishes our food editors encountered at restaurants in Rome.
5000489~Bacon, Cabbage and Gruyère Pizza~1991~23~12~131~148~4686~367~One of our favorite convenience products--packaged pizza crust--is put to excellent use in this recipe, which transforms readily available ingredients into a unique party snack or a fast and easy main course.
5000490~Chicken Sates with Peanut Curry Sauce~1238~43~8~64~95~2486~45~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.

5000494~Roquefort Dip with Apple, Endive, and Celery Hearts~904~30~21~24~73~1999~236~This dip is especially attractive served in a hollowed-out head of Castelfranco radicchio, a white radicchio with loose, pink-streaked leaves that readily open to form a bowl.
5000495~Seafood and Turkey-Sausage Gumbo~962~126~15~43~30~3906~250~Here is a terrific lower-fat version of the classic New Orleans dish.

5000497~Cavatelli Salad with Artichokes and Goat Cheese~2015~41~32~36~201~1008~119~Typical Provençal ingredients give this satisfying pasta salad a French accent. Refrigerate this at least two hours before serving.

5000500~Peaches in Ginger Syrup~1210~261~254~2~0~1147~0~Highly recommended!
5000501~Tamarind-Glazed Turkey Burgers~2484~223~141~114~130~12173~511~As culinary director for Balducci's, Katy Sparks brought take-out food to a whole new level. Instead of the typical fried chicken and heavy potato salad, the market offers horseradish-crusted salmon and grilled fingerling potatoes with lemon. In this recipe she's taken the often-bland turkey burger to a higher plane, with the addition of tamarind.
5000502~Scallop Quenelles with Gingered Tomato Sauce~851~15~3~54~65~2074~262~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5000503~Quick Kimchi~730~105~40~13~25~3164~10~No Korean meal is complete without kimchi, a piquant condiment of fermented vegetables (most popularly cabbage) seasoned with ginger, garlic, chile, and all manner of fresh or preserved seafood. Fermenting the ingredients over several days gives the dish its distinctive tang, but this easy version, which takes advantage of the funky depth of Asian fish sauce, offers relatively instant gratification.
5000943~Roasted Vegetables~2342~420~92~39~49~10163~0~Highly recommended!
5000505~Honey-Glazed Lemon Chicken~773~168~159~12~10~175~370~Highly recommended!

5000509~Beef and Broccoli Wontons with Ginger Dipping Sauce~927~108~63~36~40~8235~19~Amy likes to make these for parties. Wonton wrappers can be found in the refrigerator section and rice vinegar in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets.
5000510~Orange Rice Pudding~1125~223~117~22~15~488~56~Riz au Lait et Rosace d'Oranges
5001749~Grilled Tri-Tip Roast with Tequila Marinade and Cherry Tomato Relish~1139~38~3~0~110~250~0~Marinate the tri-tip for at least two hours.
5000512~Hamburger Soup~4981~299~84~274~289~49356~861~I made this glorious hamburger soup one Sunday in winter for three very important reasons: One, it was so ding dang cold outside, all I could think about was soup. Two, church was canceled (Church? Canceled? I don't understand.) and I didn't have anything else to do. Three, I was hungry, man.
5000513~Squid Ink Pasta with Shrimp, Nduja, and Tomato~1536~99~69~103~75~1055~880~No nduja? Just add an extra glug of olive oil along with some red pepper flakes.
5000514~Pork Chile Verde with Red Chile Salsa~2032~418~87~41~12~13900~0~"Home turf: New Mexico
Local flavor: Southwestern-style chili is all about the chiles (with an ""e""), as in this pillar of regional cooking, chile verde. The chiles are green and mild (New Mexico's famous hatch chiles are perfect), and the meat is pork. Tangy tomatillos balance the chiles and coat the slow-cooked pork. To up the regional cred, serve it ""Christmas"" style—with a combo of green and red chiles.
Make it a meal: Serve with warm corn tortillas, avocado and spinach salad with honey-lime vinaigrette, and a dark beer like Negra Modelo (Mexico, $8 per six-pack)."
5000515~Sour Cream Layer Cake with Pecan Brittle~9478~1850~1795~22~263~1099~965~Make a cake the easy way: Spruce up a mix with sour cream, chocolate, brown sugar frosting and a crunchy pecan brittle.

5000519~Red Wine-Braised Short Rib Stew with Potatoes, Carrots, and Mushrooms~3252~470~150~593~193~27120~1123~If you haven't noticed by now, we love braising. This stew wraps itself around your soul and squeezes ever so gently. And while it truly embodies the concept of a one-pot meal, we do like to roast the vegetables separately so they retain their individual flavor, creating even greater depth of flavor.
5000520~Grilled Cheese with Onion Jam, Taleggio, and Escarole~228~17~11~1~18~27~0~Highly recommended!

5000529~Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup~1016~136~74~265~124~19284~815~This rich soup is hearty enough to serve as a main course. Dried tangerine peel and star anise impart an exotic note, and pickled mustard greens provide contrast to the beefy broth.

5000531~Green Bean Ceasar Salad~1954~90~30~68~145~4636~205~This reduced-fat version hits all the flavor notes of the original Caeser.
5013004~Grandmother Walters's Biscuits~1357~232~34~94~65~5852~186~"I believe the secret to my grandmother Grace's biscuits is that she would talk to them, saying, ""Rise, Mr. Biscuit, rise!"" And they would. Her buttermilk biscuits were quite similar to these, made with whole milk, but sometimes she'd substitute buttermilk and use baking soda instead of baking powder."
5011501~Oeufs Au Plat~210~0~0~12~17~384~391~Editor's note: Serve these fried eggs with Chef John Besh's Green Onion Sausage and Shrimp Gravy .

5000535~Rice Pancakes~3300~332~4~55~222~1265~1062~"Although Nelly Custis omitted sugar in her recipe for these lovely, delicate pancakes, published cookbooks of the period often suggested ""strewing"" sugar over them before sending them to the table. E. Smith, for one, additionally recommended garnishing them with orange, a suggestion also included here. This recipe can be readily doubled."
5000536~Flourless Pistachio Cake with Strawberry Meringue~5226~573~453~143~298~1304~374~This gluten-free cake makes a stunning end to a Passover meal or any springtime dinner, with surprisingly bright layers of green pistachio cake and pink strawberry meringue.
5000537~Wild Mushroom Pierogies~1156~57~11~1~98~1206~261~A quintessential Polish comfort food, pierogies can be stuffed with potatoes, cheese, sauerkraut, or wild mushrooms. Here, dried porcini are combined with cremini mushrooms, adding a woodsy depth to the filling. Served with golden sautéed onions and sour cream, these dumplings make a delicious main dish.
5000538~Whole Fish Baked in Sea Salt~1247~147~28~47~49~43396~4~Oven-roasting whole fish marries ease of preparation with stunning presentation.
5018531~Sofrito Grilled Bread~739~105~14~25~25~2572~0~Sofrito is a sautéed vegetable mixture used as a seasoning in much of Latin America and the Caribbean. It typically contains garlic, onion, bell pepper, coriander, and sometimes tomatoes or ham, although the recipe varies among countries. In our version, we've omitted the oil normally used to cook the ingredients and instead simply puréed the vegetables.
5000540~Sorrel, Pea, and Leek Soup~613~83~18~10~21~4816~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5013118~Blue Lake Green Beans with Lemon and Thyme~365~30~15~7~23~298~63~Blue Lake is a stringless variety found at farmers' markets and specialty foods stores. Others work well, too, as long as they're fresh and tender.
5000542~Zucchini with Vinegar and Mint~3061~337~207~47~165~2551~430~This side dish is like the love child of a salad and a pickle. Make it ahead of time and serve it at room temperature with the Steak and Olives
5000543~Sauteed Black Cod with Shallot-Lemon Vinaigrette and Fresh Herb Salad~845~3~3~0~95~1~0~Improv: Try other meaty fish fillets such as halibut, swordfish, or tuna. Replace mixed herbs with mesclun.
5000544~Rosemary and Thyme Braised Lamb Shoulder~1037~45~0~5~59~11837~0~Lamb is traditionally served at Easter in Italy as well as many other countries. Although author Gina Marie Miraglia Eriquez grew up with the roasted legs of lamb prepared by her mother and grandmother, she prefers to braise a lamb shoulder. The meat turns out so tender and succulent that it's impossible to slice with a carving knife. Instead, it's pulled with a meat fork into moist, rich chunks. Depending on where you live, lamb shoulder may require a special order so be sure to allow time for a butcher to request it.
5000545~Beet Carpaccio with Goat Cheese and Arugula~693~12~10~22~65~840~79~This raw dish is all about the best ingredients you can find. A great goat cheese and a fruity, high-quality olive oil will result in flavor that's as stunning as the presentation.
5000546~Shawarma-Spiced Chicken Pita with Tahini-Yogurt Sauce~2225~62~19~166~152~4393~606~Traditional shawarma calls for roasting meat on a large vertical spit. We mimic the effect here by roasting at a high temperature, which yields chicken that is crisp on the outside yet moist and juicy on the inside.

5000550~Poached Oysters and Artichokes with Champagne Cream~2591~61~10~83~225~7452~649~Part of what makes this luxurious dish so delicious is that the spinach, artichokes, and oysters have a similar texture and the same soft, gentle flavors.
5003911~Roasted Garlic-Herb Sauce~1382~77~31~12~111~820~47~This pesto-like sauce would be great with just about any grilled seafood.

5000555~Salmon with Black Bean Sauce~461~80~19~6~3~284~10~Fermented black beans should be in everyone's pantry—they complement just about any protein and they can be turned into a sauce in no time at all. They are actually small black soy beans preserved in salt. You have to soak them to eliminate some of that salt, but then they are good to go. This sauce would go great not only with salmon, but on top of chicken, shrimp, tofu, or stir-fried vegetables. Serve with Butter-steamed Broccoli with Soy and Simple Boiled Rice.
5000556~Rosé, Bourbon, and Blue~3190~608~478~70~71~3740~210~"For this patriotic-themed cooler, Cabell Tomlinson combines two summer favorites: sweet iced tea and sangria. ""I started thinking about the Fourth of July,"" she explains. ""I had the red from the rosé and the blue from the blueberries. I still needed the white, but I decided to go with that oh-so-American spirit, bourbon."" She uses orange pekoe for the tea and suggests a fruity rosé like a Spanish Rioja."
5000557~Lemon Gnocchi with Spinach and Peas~1773~232~14~43~63~3277~216~The zing of fresh lemon enhances both the peas' sweetness and the natural flavor of the spinach. The whole quick, creamy dish is bolstered by soft pillows of potato gnocchi.

5000560~Asian Chicken and Cabbage Salad~2125~68~32~181~117~6663~599~Although it's reason alone to keep a rotisserie chicken on hand, this salad would also be great with shrimp or sliced leftover pork chops.
5000561~Mashed Potatoes with Leeks and Sour Cream~2876~521~105~52~54~15516~94~Leeks and sour cream combine here in a terrific take on mashed potatoes.

5000565~Simplest Asian Dressing~1143~33~0~1~112~788~0~The delicate flavor of rice vinegar along with the other Asian ingredients in this vinaigrette is ideal on tender greens like mizuna or mâche
5000566~White Bean and Artichoke Dip~398~68~15~8~7~707~0~If you spend evenings camped out on your sofa staring at the boob tube, take note: People who spend four hours or more in front of the TV are twice as likely to be overweight as those who watch less than an hour a day, a new study from Australia reports. Study participants' body-mass index (which measures how much of your weight is fat) increased for every hour of TV time. If you watch two hours a day, you're 57 percent more likely to be overweight than those who keep tube time to an hour or less; if you watch three or more hours, you're 91 percent more likely to be overweight. What's worse, past studies show that this pastime triggers the munchies for high-fat snacks, though researchers aren't sure why. If you must gaze at the box, channel your snack urges toward something healthful, like this creamy, low-fat dip.
5000567~Apple, Pear, and Cranberry Coffee Cake~6054~879~449~90~253~2434~281~We like to bake with a combination of apples: some sweet and some tart, some that keep their shape and others that will break down and get saucy. Adding the pear lends a perfumey quality to the cake.
5000568~Lentil Croquettes with Watercress and Kefir~2014~287~59~82~40~9162~54~One of many cool things about (super-nutritious) sprouted lentils: They don't need to be cooked first.
5000569~Deep-Fried Turkey with Herbs~867~0~0~0~93~18281~0~Deep-frying a turkey is easier than you might think, plus it frees up oven space for the rest of your Thanksgiving feast, and takes less than 2 hours from start to finish. For a complete guide to the process, see our step-by-step slideshow, How to Deep-Fry a Turkey.
5005077~Ancho-Guajillo Chile Sauce~184~36~0~0~0~5310~0~"This recipe is an accompaniment for <epi:recipelink id=""108054"">Chicken, Potato, and Carrot Enchiladas</epi:recipelink>."

5000572~Grilled-Fish Tacos~1748~332~222~23~30~4550~0~Originating in Baja California, fish tacos are now served along Mexico's coasts and in Southern California. But unlike the deep-fried versions that are so common, ours entails grilling meaty mahimahi for a smoky char that contrasts deliciously with the fresh, clean Garnishes.

For the best flavor, forgo pre-ground cardamom; take the time to shell and grind whole seeds. Hesitant about rolling out pie crusts? This recipe is for you; the crust is simply pressed into the pan.

5002074~True Vanilla Ice Cream~1893~146~143~16~148~548~503~There's nothing, um, vanilla about our homemade version of the classic. Of course, it also makes a great base for your favorite upgrades.

5000589~Bourbon Whipped Cream~845~4~3~4~96~202~327~A dollop of softly whipped fresh cream alongside a piece of pie is one of life's perfect things. If you want the cream to hold up for hours, the optional Cobasan will make it possible, with no compromise of flavor or texture. If you prefer an unsweetened counterpoint to a sweeter pastry, leave out the sugar.

5000596~White Fish Terrine with Salmon Roe and Dill~1983~32~11~32~206~5715~654~A first course with a serious wow factor. Even though this terrine is labor-intensive, it's not as fussy and last-minute as quenelles, and its ethereal texture rivals theirs. The salmon roe adds sparkle and zing both on the plate and on the palate, but if you want to take the terrine in a slightly different direction, use a small dice of blanched, peeled carrot in its place. You'll get a delicate crunch instead of a briny pop in the mouth.
5000597~Roast Chicken with Mustard-Thyme Sauce and Green Salad with Olives~1873~112~59~89~129~54374~386~The chicken gets great flavor from a six hour brine, so begin early or a day ahead.

5000601~Sambuca Brownies~2958~286~265~31~200~1590~654~Sambuca, the anise-flavored liqueur often paired with coffee, goes equally well with chocolate — especially in these moist, cake-like, pine-nut-topped brownies.
5000603~Grilled Steak Sandwiches with Brie, Roasted Peppers, and Watercress~2306~87~30~59~174~5316~706~Highly recommended!
5017938~Chimichurri Sauce~1586~33~0~0~165~0~0~This Argentinian sauce is served with both grilled meats and fish. Its spice and herbal flavors go well with the smokiness imparted by the grill, and the vinegar’s bite cuts through the richness of steak.
5008905~Buttery Sugar Cookies~3129~669~472~96~78~1164~218~When it comes right down to it, the simplest holiday cookie is, hands down, this sugar cookie. No rolling pin or sheets of wax paper are required. Just roll the dough into balls between your palms, then coat them with decorative coarse sugars. This is the perfect cookie for children starting out in the kitchen, by the way. They'll have loads of fun mixing up different colors of the sanding sugar, and messy kitchen aside, everyone will be happy when they sink their teeth into the first ones warm from the oven.
5000606~Lemon-Lime, Corn, and Jalapeño Relish~2634~195~6~23~206~2954~0~Six ingredients yield big dividends. Be sure to use a good-quality fruity olive oil.

5000610~Grilled Skirt Steak and Arugula Salad with Roquefort and Catalina Dressing~1267~34~21~112~70~3976~335~Incredibly rich and flavorful, skirt steak is ideal for this particular salad, but you can also use any other type of steak you might happen to have left over from yesterday's dinner.

5017397~Za'atar~83~3~0~1~7~1601~0~Like curry, za'atar is a spice blend that varies from cook to cook in the Middle East, its birthplace. My father was Assyrian, so I've always enjoyed the flavors of the region (though the closest I've yet traveled is Turkey). This is my interpretation, and it reflects my priorities: my favorite part of za'atar is the tart sumac, so it's particularly heavy in my version. And while some cooks grind their spices together, I like to leave the sesame seeds whole. You can find sumac in Middle Eastern groceries and from online sources such as Penzeys and Kalustyan's. For a perfect, quick snack, combine with olive oil and brush on pita.
5000617~Chicken Burgers with Lemon and Tarragon~1509~11~6~89~126~4738~222~Serve with: Parslied new potatoes and a frisée salad with goat cheese. Dessert: Pineapple sorbet with sliced strawberries.

5000622~Roasted Pineapple-Habanero Chile Salsa~532~123~13~10~8~8904~0~All the vibrant, sun-drenched brilliance of the tropics is captured in this salsa that evolves in your mouth—first sweet, then hot. Luscious ripe pineapple is a perfect partner to the fiery, fragrant habanero chile. Not only is the habanero the hottest chile readily available fresh, when cut open it releases an intense perfume of ripe tropical fruits—mango, pineapple, citrus. As a finishing touch, a squeeze of fresh lime adds a pop of flavor and brightens the sometimes cloying sweetness of a really ripe pineapple. This salsa pairs well with dishes that are tropical in origin or spirit, that have bright, fresh flavors, or that have been simply marinated or grilled, whether fish or meat. It’s delicious with almost all fish and seafood tacos and grilled chicken dishes. If you cannot find fresh habaneros, substitute one tablespoon of a fruity hot or extra-hot habanero sauce with a mango base (Melinda’s makes a good one) for the habanero chile.
5000623~Our Favorite Texas Beef Chili~6775~298~136~658~336~69578~1872~"This cowboy-style ""bowl of red"" is all about tender chunks of beef chuck and a five-chile-pepper purée. True to Texas tradition, it has no tomatoes and no beans. The heat is customizable to your taste, and don't skip the masa harina: It helps to thicken the chili and imparts a wonderful earthy richness. This chili is best served a day after cooking."
5017049~Fajitas~3300~134~35~145~230~5138~335~Start with a large platter.
5000625~Asparagus Soup with Lemon Crème Fraîche~1198~87~27~45~69~20226~210~This vegetarian starter has an incredibly silky texture, but less than a tablespoon of butter per serving.
5000626~Butternut-Corn Chowder with Goat Cheese Croutons~3581~134~7~182~259~11993~1482~"Lane Crowther, A contributing editor at Bon Appétit, says that ""For twenty-five years our family endured side dishes of canned creamed corn and sweetened baked squash—simply for the sake of tradition. With this soup, I was finally able to convince everyone that a few classic Thanksgiving ingredients (like corn and squash) could be combined in a delicious new way."""
5000627~Risotto with Chicken and Beet Greens Stalker~2611~376~9~96~82~6100~146~Highly recommended!
5006025~Bloody Mary Aspic~635~57~45~29~30~6712~2~The aspic will be a deeper shade of red if made with canned tomatoes (see cooks' note, below), but fresh tomatoes will yield a brighter flavor.

5000633~Sweet Potato Macaroni and Cheese~2485~220~140~75~149~7762~358~I’m just going to say it: this is the best macaroni cheese I’ve ever eaten – better than the macaroni cheese I ate as a child; better than the macaroni cheese I brought my own children up on when they were little (they don’t agree); better than any fancy restaurant macaroni cheese with white truffle or lobster; better than any macaroni cheese I have loved in my life thus far, and there have been many.
5004060~Leftover-Roast-Chicken-Stock~494~64~15~16~18~2227~62~This time-honored example of kitchen thrift is ready when you are: Have it simmering away while you tend to another meal or are puttering around on a Saturday morning.

5000639~Pecan-Molasses Tartlets~6533~752~398~87~359~1320~880~A whiskey-spiked variation on classic pecan pie. Serve the tartlets with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, if desired.

5000645~Portuguese Baked Eggs~2684~228~16~91~165~4416~418~Baked eggs are great for brunch, and this version is no exception. But with a salad of leafy greens, it's also hearty and satisfying enough to double as dinner.
5000646~Lemon Chicken~937~54~8~19~54~3051~76~This chicken is delicious over rice or pasta, which absorbs the tangy sauce. A salad and some crusty French bread would be fine accompaniments.

5000649~Grilled Grapefruit with Pomegranate Molasses Glaze~221~30~30~0~11~0~31~Halved grapefruits taste delicious with a kiss of smoke from the grill. But they're even better sliced to expose more of the fruit to the caramelizing fire. Pomegranate molasses, with its sweet-tart flavor and syrupy texture, makes a tasty, ruby-hued glaze. Try this recipe with oro blanco (a white-fleshed pomelo), too. If you have fresh pomegranates, scatter the seeds over the top.
5000650~Hot Ginger Tea with Cinnamon~931~95~5~16~73~25~0~Pleasantly pungent and sweetened to taste with honey, this tea soothes and refreshes after a big meal. (We also like to brew a pot any time we feel a little under the weather.) Nibbling on the pine nuts as you sip the hot tea helps soften its strong flavors.

5000666~Buttered Polenta~441~35~2~4~30~3156~47~Elena slow-cooks her polenta the traditional way, which can be a soul-satisfying experience if you set aside the time. When polenta is cooked properly, each grain of cornmeal slowly absorbs the liquid until it swells, becoming perfectly tender and seeming to disappear within the whole.
5000667~Baked Falafel With Orange-Tahini Sauce~2586~190~29~63~183~100592~0~This weeknight falafel dinner brings the Middle Eastern platter home with a tangy, orange-spiked tahini sauce, bright quick-pickled red onions, and an easy green cabbage and tomato salad.

5000673~Greek-Style Mahi Mahi~1409~51~6~0~130~2326~126~Mahimahi has a large, moist, and pleasantly firm flake. Topping it with briny feta, herbs, and lemon slices evokes the warm shores of Greece.
5000674~Grilled Pizza with Tomatoes, Corn and Cheese~4936~558~3~431~231~12031~861~Al Forno restaurant put Providence on the culinary map, and grilled pizza-invented there by chef George Germon had a lot to do with it. Here's one to make at home.
5000675~Fudgy Chocolate Layer Cake with Coffee-Chocolate Frosting~8825~1130~737~95~463~3855~1048~"""My cousin and I had a delicious chocolate cake at Watershed, a restaurant in nearby Decatur,"" writes Joyce Jue of Atlanta, Georgia. ""I'd appreciate your getting the recipe so I can learn to make it."""
5000676~Smoked Stuffed Chile Poppers~3281~68~57~128~275~6397~626~"Chile ""poppers""—just pop 'em in your mouth—are on many restaurant menus, and they're easy to prepare in your own backyard. They need to smoke at a higher temperature so the bacon wrapped around the outside of the chile gets cooked through. Although higher-heat smoking is technically not considered low-and-slow traditional barbecue, it does have its place in recipes like this one (and for people who use a ceramic smoker, which automatically smokes at a higher temperature). At a lower temperature, the bacon won't crisp up. You can also use this technique to smoke other bacon-wrapped appetizers like shrimp, water chestnuts, or green bean bundles. If you like, substitute goat cheese, garlic-and-herb cream cheese, or even pimiento cheese spread for the cream cheese and cheddar. You can also use almonds or walnuts instead of the pecans, or omit the nuts."
5000677~Pull-Apart Bread With Pumpkin and Spinach~2297~374~64~144~116~2714~320~This stunning bread gets its branch-like form by taking a shaping cue from the classic French baguette bread, Pain d'Epi (a.k.a. wheat stalk bread). Use sharp scissors to cut the dough and gently move each piece to the side to keep the rolled filling as tight as possible.
5000678~Spinach with Pine Nuts and Raisins~1079~94~36~34~68~862~0~(Spinaci con Pinoli e Passerine)
5000679~Rosé in June Fizz~475~139~47~1~0~20~0~Highly recommended!
5000680~Orzo Salad~4595~469~58~169~248~1866~122~Orzo is the Italian word for barley, and the slender, grain-shape of orzo pasta makes for a no-fuss, neatly consumed salad, particularly if you are balancing a plate while perched on the edge of a sofa or standing around the TV watching the Super Bowl. Although the salad makes for a great accompaniment to the Stuffed Sliders Your Way, your vegetarian friends will thank you for providing them with an option they will really enjoy as their main dish.
5000681~Coffee-Braised Short Ribs with Ancho Chile~1986~338~157~70~38~8771~0~Relish each step of preparing coffee- and chile-braised short ribs: Searing a brown crust on the ribs before they bake adds a deep caramelized flavor; sautéing the aromatics (onions, peppers, garlic) in the drippings makes the sauce base really fragrant.
5000682~Mini Rack of Lamb with Nutty Beluga Lentils and Sautéed Garlic Spinach~2279~331~23~93~55~2855~9~The three main elements in this recipe make an unbeatable combination. The soft, sweet taste of the lamb coupled with full green flavor of the spinach and the nutty, full-bodied taste of the lentils makes every bite a gastronomic pleasure. These lentils are one of my favorites. I've interpreted a recipe from the masterful chef Judy Rodgers of San Francisco's Zuni Café.
5000806~Golden Pineapple Chutney~1610~388~334~3~1~1561~0~"The word chutney comes from the Hindustani chatni, which means ""strong spices."" The sweet juiciness of golden pineapples — much more intensely flavored than ordinary pineapples — balances the spices with the lusciousness that only tropical foods possess. But you can substitute regular pineapple if you cannot find the golden variety, and the chutney will still be complementary. Serve it with Jerked Pork Chops or any grilled meat."

5000685~Chris Lilly's Flank Steak and Shiitake Yakitori~1780~307~245~63~34~13321~116~"When Chris Lilly is at the grill and says to you, ""Come on back and have a bite when this is ready,"" he's not making polite idle talk. Take him seriously. Ask him when it will be ready and make a point of being there. Chris, with father-in-law Don McLemore and the Big Bob Gibson competition barbeque team, has brought home so many contest cooking and sauce awards to his hometown of Decatur, Alabama, that we've lost count. Chris has honed his culinary skills to reach far beyond the basic superb down-home flavors of Alabama barbequed pork and chicken. This grilled flank steak recipe is a perfect marriage of authentic Asian flavors and grilling techniques. If you've ever enjoyed grilled meat skewers at an Asian farmers' market—Guangzhou, for example—this dish will put some good memories and wow in your mouth. Chris's version is second to none!"

5000688~Pera Bella Helena~6244~866~707~58~283~1134~653~This dessert is an Italian takeoff on a classic French dish, Poire Belle-Hélène-poached pear with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Here the pear is teamed with a hazelnut-orange_semifreddo_ (a sweet Italian frozen mousse) and a Frangelico chocolate sauce. For smaller appetites, cut the semifreddo into eight portions and the pears in half.

5000693~Turkey Sage Chowder~3325~473~155~139~83~15852~372~For a variation, you could throw in a cup of cooked vegetables left over from Thanksgiving to add texture to this creamy chowder. Serve the soup with chowder crackers, along with a spinach and pear salad. Purchased apple turnovers would make an ideal dessert.
5000694~Thick Apple Pancakes with Raspberry Sauce~4360~370~75~104~113~2905~592~This hearty breakfast dish is served at The Ahwahnee Hotel.

5000696~Tuscan Almond Cookies (Ricciarelli)~2324~166~127~75~163~1138~4~These traditional almond cookies hail from Tuscany; their texture is chewy, similar to macaroons.

5000704~Belly Acres' Better Burger~953~142~49~32~27~3192~31~Chef Rob Ray of Belly Acres in Memphis created this recipe as part of the Blended Burger Project™, a partnership with the James Beard Foundation that invites chefs to create delicious, nutritious, and sustainable burgers by blending mushrooms with meat. For his burger, Ray combines button mushrooms with beef for a juicy patty, and tops it with a zesty Ginger-Lime Mayonnaise and pickled summer squash, but feel free to top them with your own preferred pickles.

5000707~Vanilla Bean-Coconut Cupcakes with Coconut Frosting~7129~955~607~59~340~2465~1255~The secret to these moist cupcakes? Reduced coconut milk.
5000708~Seared Beef Tenderloin with Mustard-Horseradish Sauce~930~9~8~47~83~1798~118~Seared beef tenderloin with Mustard-Horseradish sauce. Guests place the beef atop baguette slices to make miniature open-face sandwiches.

5010013~Celery Duo~8099~874~267~130~445~25979~302~This recipe is an accompaniment for Daniel Boulud's Short Ribs Braised in Red Wine with Celery Duo.
5018862~Daniel Boulud's Short Ribs Braised in Red Wine with Celery Duo~1296~120~26~64~72~2918~160~Chef Boulud says that the success of this dish rests on browning the short ribs well at the beginning of cooking the dish to get the best flavors into the sauce. The Celery Duo starts with a celery root puree and ends with the braised ribs that top the beef. This recipe also can be found in the Café Boulud Cookbook, by Daniel Boulud and Dorie Greenspan.
5000712~Poppy Seed Crackers~370~51~0~17~8~2683~4~We loved L.A. chef Mary Sue Milliken's crisp baked-tortilla crackers in her pool-party menu (August 2000). Here, we invent our own version of them.
5012080~Bobotie~1261~226~89~43~56~4456~374~This would be a hot contender for South Africa's national dish! The recipe was selected for an international recipe book published in 1951 by the United Nations Organisation. Bobotie is a Cape-Malay creation, and they spice it up even more with cumin, coriander and cloves. A similar dish was known in Europe in the middle ages after the Crusaders had brought turmeric from the East. When our first Dutch settlers arrived, Holland was largely influenced by Italian cooks, and a favorite dish was a hashed meat backed with curried sauce, spiked with red pepper and 'sweetened with blanched almonds.' There are many local variations, but the idea is that the mince should be tender and creamy in texture, which means long, slow cooking. Early cooks added a little tamarind water; lemon rind and juice is a more modern adaptation.
5000714~Boneless Pork Chops with Ginger, Fig, and Lemon Compote~859~83~55~3~54~1018~31~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5000715~Summer Fruit Shrub Cocktail~1673~418~298~0~0~6408~0~Highly recommended!
5000716~Cauliflower, White Bean, and Feta Salad~43~7~5~1~0~2933~0~The colors are pale, but the flavors in this winter mix are vivid and fresh.
5000717~Roast Lobster with Pink Butter Sauce (Langouste Rôtie au Beurre Rose Hostelleries Saint-Roch)~4462~222~220~184~300~4327~1255~This French-inspired decadent lobster features a buttery pink sauce and herbes à tortue (a combination of dried thyme, oregano, basil, and marjoram).
5000719~Shrimp with Chunky Tomato-Saffron Sauce~2411~202~8~123~100~1853~1037~Highly recommended!
5012644~Ham Stock~1499~146~89~186~33~10232~408~The quantity of meat you'll have in your finished stock will vary depending on whether you use shanks or hocks. Although shanks from the butcher yield more meat, they are not as widely available as hocks, which can be found at most supermarkets.
5000721~Homemade Cultured Butter~3570~0~13~11~382~312~1258~Any heavy cream that's beaten long enough turns into butter, of course. But by incorporating one extra step in the process—culturing the cream with buttermilk or yogurt, essentially turning it into tangy, funky crème fraîche—this recipe reaches a whole new depth of flavor.
5000722~Honey-Turmeric Pork with Beet and Carrot Salad~2898~102~63~168~189~9722~622~A little honey in the marinade helps these cutlets caramelize, guaranteeing they'll be nicely browned despite the super-short cooking time.
5009344~Beef Bone Broth~685~121~28~17~11~2376~0~The longer you cook this nourishing broth, the more savory and concentrated it will become. Roasting the bones and vegetables beforehand will add even more flavor and richness. Season and sip this restorative broth on its own, use it as a cooking liquid for grains or legumes, or deploy it as a base for sauces and soups like hearty, healthy Detox Pho.
5000724~Grilled Steak Salad with Green Beans and Blue Cheese~2043~173~102~105~99~382519~210~When buying green beans, look for the skinniest ones—they have the best texture. Offer plenty of crusty bread, and open a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon to go with this hearty main-course salad.
5000725~Broccoli Rabe with Melted Garlic~4452~147~71~142~366~16755~563~Thinly sliced garlic is simmered in olive oil until it is so tender that it nearly melts.
5000726~Green Bean Niçoise Salad~2410~308~77~46~86~9001~370~This vegetarian version of the classic French salad is brimming with bright spring vegetables, a lemony Dijon dressing, and tangy fried capers.
5000727~Chili-Rubbed Rib-Eye Steaks~83~22~22~28~11~14660~80~Highly recommended!

5000730~Creamy Fennel and Greens Soup~903~51~6~19~74~1907~188~Soup is a great way to use up leftover greens, especially the leafy tops of beets or turnips, which too often get tossed in the compost pile. In this suave, satisfying soup, braising beet tops and collard greens (left over, respectively, from Smoked–Sable Tartare with Beets and Watercress and Wild–Mushroom Bundles ) with fennel and onion mellows the greens' hearty flavor and brings out a surprising smoothness (heightened by the cream stirred in at the end). Adding the spinach just before blending helps keep the color bright.
5005509~Grilled Tea-Brined Turkey with Tea-and-Lemon Gravy~8118~2858~376~0~58~187115~0~For best flavor and moist, juicy meat, brine the turkey for 36 to 48 hours. If you are planning to brine it in a cooler, plan on needing extra ice. Kosher salt is preferred in most brine recipes for its pure flavor and because it dissolves quickly.
5000732~Beef Tenderloin with Red Wine Sauce, Creamed Spinach, and Truffled French Fries~1605~72~43~3~131~532~345~The truffled fries are an inspired, luxurious accompaniment.
5005692~Smoky Tomato Sauce~833~79~34~12~45~688~47~Grill the tomatoes just before you place the eggplants in the coals.
5000734~Blueberry Almond Praline Sundae~2330~350~301~45~102~1026~0~Highly recommended!
5014499~Lime, Garlic, and Oregano Mojo~1493~14~0~0~165~2908~0~"This is the ""he-man"" of mojos, and the classic combination of lime, garlic, and oregano is a must for grilled red meats. Try it with flank steaks, T-bones, sirloin steaks, or lamb."
5000736~Raw Nut Butter~29~1~0~0~1~0~0~Don’t like dairy butter? Give this a try. You can use almost any nut, so get creative.
5000737~Olive Focaccia Dough~977~227~2~100~32~2263~0~"This recipe was created to prepare <epi:recipeLink =""14257"">Miniature Olive Focaccias with Marinated Peppers</epi:recipeLink>."
5000738~Middle Eastern Spiced Lamb Steaks with Poached Quince~1403~274~269~21~29~2238~81~The combination of meat and fruit is common in Middle Eastern cuisine. If you aren't familiar with quinces, you might mistake them for hard, yellow apples. They are too tart to eat raw, but become fragrantly delicious (and a lovely shade of pink) when cooked with sugar. Serve this dish with the bulgur with apricots and almonds.
5000739~Fried Rice with Canadian Bacon~3438~649~36~85~48~2728~10~Highly recommended!
5000740~Venison Daube with Cumin and Coriander~1446~63~6~72~98~5037~220~"The Lenz Winery, one of the oldest on Long Island, has had the same winemaker, Eric Fry, since 1989. Fry's mantra is ""Ripe fruit!"" — and hows in the Lenz Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine has an amazing concentration of flavors, an intense raspberry and black-cherry nose, and smooth tannins that provide a long finish. In short, it's a perfect partner for Fry's deeply flavored venison stew."
5000741~Central Asian Rice and Bean Stew~1962~288~85~60~56~7806~33~"The word mash means mung bean in Farsi and Farsi-related languages like Azeri and Tajik, as well as in Turkic languages such as Uzbek and Uighur. The word kichiri is like the Hindi word kitchri, a name for rice dishes made by cooking rice together with other ingredients. (The British took the idea and the name and turned it into ""kedgeree."")"
5000742~Hazelnut Brittle~1892~153~130~18~142~4~189~Highly recommended!
5000743~Pear Champagne Cocktail~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~We chose to garnish our cocktail with Seckel or Forelle pear slices because of their small size — they fit perfectly in the Champagne flutes. Be sure to lower the slices slowly into the flute or the Champagne will bubble over.
5000744~Sweet and Tangy Hummus~114~20~5~4~1~248~0~Red pepper paste gives this garlic-free hummus its color and smoky-sweet flavor; find it in Middle Eastern markets or online.
5000745~Beef and Sausage Meat Loaf with Mozzarella~4244~286~88~354~200~16028~783~"Armandino Batali of Salumi in Seattle, writes: ""My son, Mario Batali, may be the most recognizable foodie in the family, but the Batalis' interest in Italian cooking and culture goes back generations. My grandfather opened Seattle's first Italian-food import store in 1903. It was located just a few steps from where my restaurant, Salumi, is now, and it's one of the things that inspired me to get into the business."
5000746~Tequila Tropical Punch~70~15~12~0~0~251~0~Highly recommended!
5000747~Kiddie Cobb Salad~4341~38~24~34~441~5616~1442~The Cobb is a protein-packed salad that will stick with your kids through the school day. This version relies on smoked turkey for the signature flavor that typically comes from bacon. Blue cheese is an optional add-in since its flavor is too strong for a lot of little ones. The assembly is more composed than chopped, which makes it as pretty as it is tasty.
5000748~Baked Oysters with Bacon and Leeks~3108~152~45~90~217~4810~631~Use fresh oysters if you can; note that the recipe also tested well using oysters packed in jars. If the oysters are very large, cut them in half.
5000749~Tuscan Tuna Salad with Fennel~2104~48~21~25~207~3985~57~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are from Starting with Ingredients: Quintessential Recipes for the Way We Really Cook by Aliza Green. To read Epicurious's review of the cookbook, go to The Best Cookbooks of 2006.

5011407~Cauliflower-Leek Kugel with Almond-Herb Crust~2088~212~66~47~92~5105~370~Coarsely mashed vegetables are the main ingredients in this utterly surprising — and irresistible — kugel.
5009676~Classic Pesto~1349~33~0~23~127~2825~59~Some say using a blender rather than a food processor results in a smoother puree. When combining pesto with pasta, Ligurians mix a small ladle of the cooking water into the pesto just before adding the noodles; this dilutes the concentrated sauce and helps it adhere to the pasta.
5019748~Turkey Giblet Stock~700~54~13~3~33~4712~0~Classic Italian stock vegetables enhance this amber-gold broth for an unbeatable gravy that really complements the turkey.
5000755~Rockin' Moroccan Stew~6577~926~278~165~246~5937~39~Effort Level: II
5000756~Grilled Peppered Dry Spareribs~221~59~59~0~0~53547~0~These ribs get the benefit of a lemon pepper accent mixed with complementary seasonings and finished with an apple juice baste. We think they're best hot off the grill without any other seasonings. If you must, serve them with barbecue sauce on the side.

5000775~Herb-and-Spice Southern Fried Chicken~4438~304~106~234~50~2078~370~A certain well-known take-out chicken with eleven herbs and spices is not the only Southern fried chicken that is seasoned with a complex blend of herbs and spices; it is just one of many. You can experiment with the combination until you have your own unique blend. If you don't have a couple of the spices on hand, feel free to omit them. When deep-fried, which is the way I prefer to cook this one, the chicken makes great picnic fare because it stays crispy long after it's cold, and the spice and herb seasoning stands up well to other highly seasoned picnic food.

These days what I really enjoy doing is baking. Not only is it more leisurely, but people enjoy the results so much. About twice a month my husband takes some of my homemade cookies to his colleagues who always ask when I'm going to send something their way. The staff in the doctor's office where I work will often ask me the same thing. My zucchini bread is a special favorite. I joke with people and tell them I'll bring it in, but only if they behave."""

5000819~Roast Rack of Lamb~2018~191~155~120~92~6731~448~"A rack is one of the most luxurious cuts from the lamb and makes a dramatic roast. Count on two ribs per person (four servings per rack) if you're using American lamb and four ribs per serving if you're using New Zealand or Australian lamb. When carving, alternate sides as you serve the ribs so one person isn't stuck with the ""seconds,"" the ribs from the shoulder end of the rack.
If you have a double rack of lamb, split it. This removes the chine bone automatically. If you have a single rack, make sure the butcher trims off the chine bone so you can carve the rack easily. French the rack and remove the layer of fat that covers half of the rack on the shoulder end. This helps the meat to cook evenly."
5000820~Winter Herb Pasta~3822~631~41~91~100~532~63~Thanks to Simon and Garfunkel, the fresh herbs in this dish are forever linked. But the folk duo probably never knew how good they are on top of al dente bucatini, a thicker-than-spaghetti hollow noodle.

5000842~Poached Sockeye Salmon with Mustard Herb Sauce~1810~34~8~3~188~73334~253~We adopted contributing editor Jon Rowley's technique for poaching salmon in water salted like the sea. This method imparts a touch of brine and enables the other seasonings to permeate the fish. Cut into very thick steaks instead of left whole, the fish is easier to handle and doesn't require a poacher. The creamy sauce makes for a sophisticated finish.

Some consist solely of ice cream molded and then decorated to resemble a cake, while others intersperse layers of ice cream with thin layers of cake, crisp meringue, or even crumbled cookies. Our red, white, and blue July 4th extravaganza is a gorgeous amalgam of ice cream, cake, and blueberries and raspberries cooked separately into their own jammy fillings. Frosted simply in sweetened whipped cream and topped with more berries, this cake sparkles as much as the fireworks in the sky!

The flavor of vanilla always improves a cake, cookies or a tart, and can even add an alluring flavor to bread. This sugar is also delicious stirred into plain yogurt, sprinkled atop buttered toast and for dipping strawberries.

5012952~Basic Duck Stock~285~57~13~1~3~1115~0~This is my standard duck or goose stock. It is the stock that I call for in the recipes in this book. In other words, you need to make lots.

And since I converted the bedroom next to my kitchen into a pantry for extra storage, I know I'll always have the right ingredients at my fingertips."""

5003299~Coconut Sauce~206~33~11~7~3~2254~11~If most of the coconut sauces you've encountered have been heavy and cloying, this one — light and frothy, with delicate flavor — will be a delicious surprise. It would also be perfect for spicing up poached skinless boneless chicken.
5000888~Bittersweet Chocolate Pudding Pie with Crème Fraîche Topping~4128~279~227~31~325~932~1071~An intense dark-chocolate filling topped with sweet-tangy cream.
5000889~Miso-Tofu Ranch Dip~400~24~18~19~24~2247~0~Umami-loaded ingredients (tofu and miso) make this the most addictive ranch ever.
5012327~Grass-Fed Beef Meatloaf in a Bacon Blanket~2808~203~91~126~157~7417~668~It's good news for America that grass-fed beef is increasingly available in supermarkets. Cattle were meant to eat grass, and they are efficient at converting that green goodness into nutrient-dense meat, rich in heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids as well as vitamins A and E, to say nothing of environmental benefits. Because grass-fed beef is leaner than grain-fed, it's not quite as tender. So turning it into a meatloaf is a greatand economicalway to make a meal of it.
5000891~Hominy, Tomato, and Chili Soup~964~134~26~15~38~3630~0~Tostadas caseras — corn tortillas that have been seasoned and fried — can be found with the tortillas in most supermarkets. The soup can be made one day before serving.
5000892~Lemon Sabayon with Grapefruit~1176~203~199~21~33~342~437~This remarkable sabayon, made with egg yolks left over from Spiced–Pumpkin Soufflés with Bourbon Molasses Sauce , tastes like a very lush and airy lemon curd. Pairing it with juicy segments of grapefruit creates a delightful call and response between the two citruses and their varying decibels of sweetness and tart zing. (The sabayon also pairs well with oranges or berries.) Though it is traditional to serve sabayon still warm—from the simmering water over which it is whisked—this version also tastes delicious chilled.
5000893~Meringue Kisses with Passion-Fruit Fool~3621~665~647~24~111~1899~318~Highly recommended!
5006589~Vinegared Rice~859~200~14~15~0~1938~0~Highly recommended!

5000896~Flourless Almond Cookies With Cardamom, Orange Zest, and Pistachios~5004~461~313~131~329~847~20~Both cardamom and pistachios are essential ingredients in Persian dessert making. This dough is delicate because it doesn’t contain any gluten, so be sure it’s fully chilled and firm before rolling into logs and slicing into cookies.
5000897~Penne with Pancetta and Tomato-Cream Sauce~2819~378~19~77~98~1756~210~Using the fresh-tasting canned diced tomatoes eliminates the chopping step. Serve with: Arugula and radicchio salad.
5000898~Korean Vegetable Rice Bowl~981~89~33~49~51~4819~414~Bibimbop
5000899~Grilled Peaches with Black Pepper and Basil-Lime Syrup~704~149~139~4~12~250~0~The black pepper adds a surprising aromatic and spicy flavor to the sweet grilled peaches.

5000907~Warm Sweet-Potato Pudding with Apples and Chestnuts~2523~377~352~19~108~411~689~Think of the best sweet-potato pie you've ever eaten and then take away the crust so you can revel solely in its silky goodness. A bite of this pudding is full and round, with hits of chestnut and dried fruit.
5000908~Balsamic Roasted Tomato and Goat Cheese Crisps~627~96~8~12~22~40689~58~The French like to cook using small amounts of intensely flavored ingredients, such as balsamic vinegar and goat cheese.
5000909~Whole Wheat Bran Muffins with Figs and Pecans~4071~489~220~86~98~5243~370~Highly recommended!
5000910~Risotto with Asparagus and Morel Ragoût~3188~474~17~58~116~7519~214~This dish has a livelier, fresher taste than traditional risotto because the vegetables are cooked separately from the rice and then spooned over it in a rich ragout.

5008768~Barbecued Turkey with Maple-Mustard Glaze~7696~877~381~60~408~104550~97~First the turkey is soaked overnight in a brine to improve flavor and ensure moist meat. (Be sure to use a pot large enough to hold both the brine and the turkey.) The smokiness of the turkey is offset beautifully by the tangy, sweet glaze, which incorporates two quintessential Napa Valley ingredients: wine and mustard.
5006881~Vegetable and Bean Chili~905~103~34~12~45~5057~44~With some warm corn bread, this chili is a meal in itself. You wouldn't know there was chocolate in the recipe, but it adds a subtle depth of flavor to the dish.
5000918~Caramelized Walnuts~2889~177~138~50~228~14~0~Highly recommended!
5000919~Tomato, Onion, and Roasted Lemon Salad~921~93~63~5~57~908~0~Sugared, roasted lemons are edible from rind to flesh and give this salsa-like mix a bracing jolt of sourness.

5016817~Barba Yianni's Grilled Lamb~267~56~10~1~3~2827~0~Here's our version of Barba Yianni's grilled lamb. The marinade works equally well with lamb chops, kebabs, or butterflied leg of lamb. You can also use it on pork or chicken. Skordalia is often made with mashed potatoes or bread soaked in water, but we feel the yogurt gives it more flavor. Skordalia is also good with grilled fish or chicken breasts.
5000924~Lobster Rolls with Lemon Vinaigrette and Garlic Butter~1304~129~58~7~78~139~214~Not in the mood for bread? No problem. This no-mayo lobster mixture would also make an ideal centerpiece in a summer salad.

5000930~Roast Turkey with Corn Bread Stuffing and Giblet Gravy~2446~234~96~50~118~99434~656~A flavorful turkey prepared in an interesting way. It is soaked in brine, which helps tenderize the bird, and then rubbed with a citrus-thyme butter. The butter keeps the turkey moist and also enriches the pan drippings for the gravy. The stuffing borrows from the long tradition of corn breads in America. Be sure to make the Giblet Broth before you start roasting the turkey. Pour hard cider throughout dinner.
5000931~Pancetta, Mizuna, and Tomato Sandwiches with Green Garlic Aïoli~2005~63~11~8~196~2115~264~If you can't find green garlic, just blanch a regular garlic clove in boiling water for two minutes to soften its bite.
5000932~Peach and Mango Daiquiri~1173~261~123~18~5~330~0~Highly recommended!
5000933~Watermelon Sorbet~808~192~192~0~0~76~0~Seedless watermelons are on the market these days, but I prefer the old-fashioned ones with big black seeds — easy to see and remove. Then proceed with the recipe.

5000936~Chicken Breasts with Sun-Dried Tomato-Cream Sauce~1923~102~18~28~133~3504~359~"""Cooking is my passion, and my husband and some of our friends share it,"" Kim Bartel, Youngstown, Ohio. ""Our favorite weekend activity is making dinner together and pairing it with wine. When developing new recipes, I often refine and retest, but everyone loved this chicken dish the first time around. I serve it with rice, green beans and a crisp Chardonnay."""
5000937~Chocolate Toasted Almond Torte~3556~325~230~92~230~2463~415~Rich with chocolate and studded with bits of toasted almonds with a faint coconut flavor, this heavenly dessert is a special finish to a holiday meal. Because the leavening comes from aeration, it is essential that the ingredients be at room temperature before assembling the batter.

5000948~Braised Chicken with Dates and Moroccan Spices~3738~383~275~315~60~13546~715~Medjool dates work well in this braise, which should be served with enough couscous to soak up the delicious juices.

5000950~Low-Fat Orange and Almond Cream Cheese Pie~3952~514~209~162~130~1413~113~This dessert tastes indulgent, but it's made with nonfat cottage cheese, nonfat cream cheese and evaporated skim milk.

5000960~Charred Romaine with Tomatillo Dressing~1582~95~27~16~134~4794~56~Charred to a crisp: Not a statement usually associated with salads, but delicious nonetheless in this Mexican-inspired romaine number.

5000962~Chocolate-Almond Iced Coffee~1987~279~248~25~84~550~141~Adjust the strength of the coffee to suit your taste, using 1 cup of ground beans for milder coffee or 1 1/2 cups for a stronger brew. The recipe calls for chocolate-almond-flavored coffee beans, but go ahead and try any flavor you like.
5000963~Arugula, Bacon, and Gruyère Bread Pudding~5821~802~48~213~184~10899~821~Here, we pepped up the fail-safe brunch combination of bacon, egg, and cheese by adding handfuls of flavorful sautéed arugula. They'll be jumping out of bed for this one.
5000964~Apricots with Amaretto Syrup (Albicocche Ripiene)~993~95~86~12~63~64~63~In a twist on the classic Italian combination of peaches and Amaretto, Ferrigno pairs fresh apricots with a seriously over-the-top syrup, made with amaretti and the liqueur, that plays up the complexity of the sweet-and-tart fruit.

5000968~Halibut with Carrots, Fennel, Lemon, and Garlic~2123~49~9~1~220~77~0~An alternative to traditional gefilte fish, this cold, oven-steamed halibut makes an elegant fish course. Conveniently, it should be prepared one day ahead.

5000971~Spicy Pork Soup~848~125~22~77~9~6217~102~Larry's inspiration for this soup was a dish that he enjoyed while vacationing in Japan. Look for the oriental sesame oil in the Asian foods section of the supermarket.
5000972~Mango, Berry & Banana Smoothie~959~183~117~20~12~672~2~Tasty, and healthy, too: Coconut water is high in potassium and other electrolytes. And Flaxseeds are a good source of beneficial omega-3s.

5000976~Six-Spice Hanger Steak~553~136~20~9~3~3179~0~During a research trip to Hong Kong, food editor Ian Knauer discovered that every family has its own recipe for five-spice powder, a pivotal ingredient in so many Chinese dishes. He took things a step further by adding black peppercorns to the aromatic mix, which holds its own against the robust flavor of hanger steak. As for side dishes, this would be delicious with steamed rice and stir-fried bok choy, but your menu doesn't have to be Asian—try it with a brightly dressed green salad and roasted potatoes.
5001527~Lemongrass Consommé~858~122~26~32~23~7041~62~This recipe originally accompanied Lemongrass Consommé with Matzoh Balls, Leeks, and Shiitake Mushrooms

5000979~Chicken Cacciatore with Harissa, Bacon, and Rosemary~1973~267~45~78~61~4209~136~"Recently, I have become a bit of a chicken thigh person, finding the meat moister and more succulent than the ubiquitous chicken breast. The addition of harissa, the spicy, tomato-y Moroccan paste, adds a subtle kick to this ""hunter-style"" Italian dish, but for those not in love with an extra bit of spice, then tomato purée works beautifully too."
5000980~Yukon Gold Potato and Chive Soup~1072~238~13~29~3~5249~0~This soup has the classic flavors of a baked potato topped with sour cream and chives. It would be perfect as a starter to a meal of steak and salad, or terrific teamed with crusty bread for lunch.
5000981~Duck Salad with Cheese Toasts and Port-Currant Sauce~1761~104~10~56~125~2148~5~If you are not able to find Pont l'Evêque cheese, either Taleggio or Brie would also work well in this lovely starter from Charlie Trotter's in Chicago.

5000985~Moroccan Salmon Crudo with Yogurt~434~22~11~55~44~1356~126~One of the secrets to this raw salmon dish from Seattle restaurant Madison Park Conservatory is an amazing Moroccan spice blend called ras el hanout. It's like a curry powder in that there are a billion unique combinations, with each cook creating his or her own, though most include Moroccan favorites like cardamom, ginger, or mace. The blend is sold in fancy grocery stores or in Middle Eastern markets like the one near us in Pike Place Market that smells like heaven. You can also buy it online. If you can't find Greek yogurt, let plain yogurt drain a bit in a colander until thick before using.
5000986~Cane Vinegar Chicken with Pearl Onions, Orange & Spinach~801~83~22~33~32~2214~166~One-pot dishes are all about planning well and laying out your prep in a smart sequential order. The beauty of this dish is the vinegar, which is malty, nutty, and nuanced. I love a Philippine cane vinegar called Datu Puti. Great stuff, super-inexpensive, and readily available at most Asian grocery stores.
5000987~Jamaican Jerk Salmon and Mango Pineapple Salsa~567~79~33~29~11~2182~46~Bright yellow mango sweetens the deal and adds a dose of vitamin A, which helps keep your skin glowing and clear.

5001003~Five-Spice Apple Quince Pie~4318~986~531~49~23~1352~63~More pastry chefs are using spices typically associated with savories in their sweets. Here, Chinese five-spice powder, a blend of warm spices and aromatic flavorings, adds allure to a fruit filling.
5001004~Chicken Curry with Sweet Potatoes~2455~123~53~182~137~8616~818~Ca ri ga
5014307~Black-Bean Shrimp with Chinese Broccoli~579~49~4~23~18~3495~194~A Chinese meal is incomplete without something leafy, and this dish features a wonderful green. The pleasant bite of gai lan, or Chinese broccoli, complements stir-fried shrimp beautifully; once you've tried it, you'll be eager to cook with it again.
5001006~Grilled Chicken and Shrimp Kebabs with Lemon and Garlic~261~33~0~43~3~269~265~Look for deveined shrimp still in the shell at the seafood counter or in the frozen foods section of the market. If you like, marinate the chicken and shrimp for an hour at room temperature or two hours in the fridge, turning skewers occasionally.
5001007~Baked Apples with Dates, Almonds and Rum~2765~303~255~38~156~556~237~Golden Delicious apples, as well as other good baking varieties like Rome Beauty, are a natural choice here.
5011247~Juicy Bella~339~62~13~11~6~1624~4~"You know the Juicy Lucy, right? It's a cheese-stuffed burger that was born in Minneapolis in the 1950s, and legend has it that it got its name when the first patron took a bite and exclaimed, ""That's one juicy lucy!"" Well, my friend Erin Meister, who blogs as The Nervous Cook, sent me her take on it: a marinated portobello mushroom cap stuffed with a runny-yolk egg. A total umami bomb and, like the Juicy Lucy, a mess to eat. But when you're cooking for yourself who cares if you have egg on your face? Erin marinates the mushroom in a miso-vinegar mixture, but since I usually have Sesame Miso Vinaigrette on hand, it's perfect to use here, too. If you don't have it, substitute 1 tablespoon of white miso in 3 tablespoons of rice vinegar. If you don't have a grill, don't sweat it; you won't get the smoky tinge, but this works just fine instead, using a cast-iron skillet or grill pan fitted with a lid (or aluminum foil)."
5001009~Potato and Pea Salad with Chive Aïoli~6790~1107~217~119~193~32328~253~Aioli, the garlicky Provençal mayonnaise, is accented with chives and Dijon mustard.

5001014~Spinach Salad with Bosc Pears, Cranberries, Red Onion, and Toasted Hazelnuts~1813~161~54~47~110~3489~0~This spinach salad speaks to all the wonderful autumnal flavors of the Pacific Northwest. The new crop of bronzed Bosc pears is piled high at the farmers' market; the hazelnuts have been harvested, shelled, and bagged for sale; and the cranberries arrive from the Long Beach, Washington, coastal bogs. I buy sweetened dried cranberries from a local producer, but they are readily available at the grocery store (Ocean Spray is a good-quality packager), found alongside raisins and other dried fruits. This salad is a snap to assemble if you buy the packaged prewashed and trimmed baby spinach.
5013057~Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese-Lemon Zest Frosting~6290~906~626~121~302~5091~370~My son's teachers beg me to make this cake for his snack day at school. It isn't too sweet, and it has a moist, dense texture from the carrots and pineapple. It's also one of my most popular cakes at weddings and parties. When I make it at home, I throw more things into the batter—for example, a handful of pumpkin seeds or toasted pecans if I have them lying around. The beauty of this recipe is that you can increase the spices or omit the nuts, and it will still taste great.

5008941~Almond Butter Crisps~513~119~118~9~0~679~4~This dough can also be formed into crescent shapes and coated with confectioners' sugar while still warm, as is done in many eastern European countries.

5001029~Halibut with Vegetable Ragoût~1319~210~38~87~6~2009~35~With the mercury rising, who wants to feast on a winter stew? Lighten up with this dish from Sondra Bernstein, author of The Girl & the Fig Cookbook (Simon &Schuster). It features fresh herbs and veggies and a protein-packed halibut fillet.

5001031~Lentil Soup, Date Balls, Celery Salad~1203~220~171~22~27~17950~0~This is my version of harira, the national soup of Morocco, which shows up in unending variations from city to city, street stall to street stall, and family to family. It can be vegan, vegetarian, or made with meat—usually lamb. Some cooks add chickpeas, chicken gizzards, or broken-up bits of angel hair pasta. But the result is always unmistakably harira, and that's what makes it so comforting and satisfying.
5001032~Slightly Sweet Dill Refrigerator Pickles~1900~449~408~12~8~19613~0~Substituting rice vinegar (instead of cider or wine vinegar) produces a pickle that's less tart.

It consists of diverse aromatic herbs that make the hillsides white with little flowers in the spring and inspire one of the island's nicknames, ""the Scented Isle."" A blend of these herbs, called herbes de maquis, is a flavoring for many seafood specialties, including this rich pasta and lobster dish. Many say that the most flavorful lobsters in the Mediterranean come from the waters off Corsica."

5015384~Salted Brown Butter Cookies~2654~525~273~97~78~1693~220~"Just reading the words ""salted brown butter"" is enough to tickle your taste buds. But making salted brown butter the flavor base of a cookie will turn your holiday cookie swap into the hottest, hippest party in town. Thankfully, the dough is a dream to roll out, and it's strong enough to keep the shape of the cookie-cutters you use, no matter how intricate. Want to hang them on the tree? Just cut a little hole before baking with the narrow end of a pastry bag tip. Keep this recipe handy for when you've got a houseful of kids on a school break and need a project to get them off their cell phones!"

Allowing the pork to cool overnight in the broth ensures its succulence — and because it's made ahead, this dish is ideal for entertaining.
5001049~Chinese Chicken Noodle Soup with Spinach and Garlic Chives~383~25~5~12~3~3068~10~In Chinese culture, noodles symbolize longevity and are often served at New Year celebrations and traditionally left very long.

Alvarado-Gómez of Erie, Pennsylvania, writes: ""I came to the United States as an exchange student, after spending the first 18 years of my life in Mérida, Yucatán. On school vacations I would go home and cook with my mother and sisters so that I wouldn't lose my touch. My mother was a skilled cook, and I was lucky to have learned at her side. Her food was so popular in our neighborhood that she sold portions of our daily meals to other families. With nine well-fed kids, she said we were her best advertisement."
5007672~Ginger Ice Milk~1436~179~172~27~55~1413~426~"The lively flavor of this ice is a perfect accompaniment to fruit salad. The key to its smooth texture is making a ginger ""tea,"" then combining it with the remaining ingredients, rather than simply incorporating pieces of ginger into the custard mixture."

5001072~Fava Bean and Spring Vegetable Soup~773~115~22~37~16~5504~0~You can use frozen baby lima beans (with the same delicious result) instead of the fresh favas, which are harder to find.

5016367~Garlic and Herb Spatchcock Grilled Chicken~640~33~0~0~55~3877~0~Spatchcocking (or splitting and flattening) this Italian-influenced chicken before grilling helps it cook more quickly and evenly, creating the ultimate combo: Juicy meat and crispy skin.

5001110~Miso Soup with Carrots and Tofu~90~9~6~6~2~77~0~Traditional miso soup begins with dashi, a Japanese seaweed and fish broth, but we found this simplified version, made with water, very satisfying as well.
5001111~Sour Cream Pastry Dough~2145~338~9~151~122~2331~214~The amount of water necessary to make pastry dough is likely to change slightly from time to time, depending on variables such as humidity and the moisture content of your butter and even, believe it or not, your flour.

5015737~Roast Goose with Port Gravy~518~72~15~12~2~4488~0~We've learned from experience that, because goose gives off so much fat in roasting, it's necessary to use a deep (at least 2 inches) roasting pan (do not use a non-stick pan). We also recommend using a metal bulb baster — the hot goose fat may melt a plastic one.

5001245~Southeast Asian Beef and Rice-Noodle Soup~3076~417~123~417~230~10479~1205~"Inspired by Vietnamese pho (pronounced ""fuh""), this soup creates its own broth as meaty short ribs and beef shank simmer with ginger, garlic, chile, and the sweet spice of star anise and cinnamon—supermarket ingredients that come together with slippery rice noodles to produce a wonderfully fragrant and authentic-tasting dish. Its a great choice for a party, because everyone gets to customize their bowl to their own taste with a spritz of lime, some fiery Sriracha sauce and sweet hoisin, and a scattering of mint and cucumber."

5001257~Lemon Cream Pie~1879~222~211~15~112~380~706~I've always found lemon curd too sweet and heavy on its own. Folded into whipped cream, however, it makes a wonderful pie filling.

5005293~Grilled Pork Kebabs with Ginger Molasses Barbecue Sauce~407~91~79~0~0~1840~0~If you are making the creamed grilled corn and are using a charcoal grill, grill the corn first, then add more briquettes to keep the fire hot while you finish up the corn dish on the stove. Then keep the corn warm, covered, over low heat while grilling the grilled scallions with lemon and pork.
5001270~Roasted Short Ribs With Cauliflower And Celery~1235~84~5~17~86~549~0~Richly marbled beef ribs beg for something crisp and refreshing to go alongside. If celery’s not your fave, try swapping it for any type of radish, escarole, or a tart apple.

5001272~Tuscan Kale Caesar Slaw~2715~126~37~72~215~1990~148~The crisp-tender texture and robust flavor of thinly sliced Tuscan kale stands up to the tart, Caesar-like dressing of this hearty slaw. Serve as a first course or as a side with grilled chicken, beef, or lamb.
5002926~Vanilla and Almond Frosting~14568~2484~2484~0~571~0~1576~One buttercream base makes two frosting flavors. Vanilla tops the orange cupcakes , and almond tops the devil's food . Be sure to use unsprayed (nontoxic) roses for decoration.

And all it takes is a food processor and a whisk. The crust—made from chocolate wafer cookies and melted chocolate—is simply pressed into the pan. The filling is just a mix of sweet, bright, and tangy ingredients.
5014624~Chocolate-Strawberry-Orange Wedding Cake~18204~3248~2464~358~653~13208~1878~Like the cake layers, the frosting is made in two separate batches; each batch yields about eight cups.

5001281~Provençal Braised Lamb Chops~3528~597~143~54~67~17413~0~It might seem like a joke to include a recipe designed to use up leftover white wine (from our Roast Turkey with Black Truffle Butter and White–Wine Gravy )—after all, why not just drink it?—but if you take the time to make this marvelous one–dish lamb dinner, you might find yourself hoarding half–empty bottles so you can make it again and again. Lamb shoulder chops are an inexpensive cut that benefits from braising, and the wine really helps tenderize the connective tissues running through the flavorful meat. Snuggling the lamb between sheets of thinly sliced potatoes, plus scatterings of golden garlic, onions, and thyme sprigs, creates a handsome and wonderfully aromatic dish.
5001282~Tomatoes and Feta Cheese with Herb-and-Garlic Dressing~2164~49~9~0~220~390~0~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

In this longtime staple of community cookbooks, they are turned into a shallow cake and spread with caviar. We used supermarket lumpfish caviar, but if you're feeling flush, use the good stuff, or even Japanese tobiko (flying-fish roe).

5015134~Cilantro Garlic Yogurt Sauce~378~24~19~33~16~127~85~Like tsatsiki, but with cilantro standing in for the mint, this tangy sauce packs a sneaky cayenne kick and makes an ideal accompaniment to grilled shrimp as well as the rice pilaf and the chicken kebabs.
5013577~Chicken Kebabs~1540~43~9~172~75~770~815~Soaking the chicken overnight in a yogurt marinade results in pillow-tender chunks faintly flavored with garlic. Turmeric adds a spark of Middle Eastern flavor and a happy orange hue.

5001313~Minted Orange, Fennel and Red Onion Salad~697~83~56~0~41~1460~0~Note: To slice the onion and fennel in the following salad into paper-thin spirals, we used a Japanese rotary device known as the Benriner vegetable slicer.

5001316~Red-Bean Soup with Gremolata~1343~169~49~13~59~2366~0~Latin-food authority Maricel Presilla describes sofrito—the sautéed mix of aromatic vegetables that is the bedrock of this vegetarian soup—as the DNA of the Latin kitchen because it carries a basic flavor code. There's onion and garlic, to be sure, but also tomatoes and various herbs, spices, and chiles, depending on the region. For this red-bean soup, we were inspired specifically by Puerto Rico, as evidenced by recao (an herb similar to cilantro) and by chiles that are fruity rather than hot. Just for fun, we included a last-minute sprinkling of Italian gremolata for brightness.
5001317~Hot Buttered Bourbon and Cider~3225~604~524~50~62~2554~251~Garnish this warming drink with lemon slices and a cinnamon stick.

5001319~Pork and Chive Dumplings with Dried Shrimp~3660~343~45~234~215~13179~349~"These classic pleated Chinese dumplings are delicious either steamed or fried. When fried, they're called ""pot stickers."" Though the dough is easy to make, if you're short on time you can use premade round gyoza wrappers (also called dumpling or pot sticker wrappers) instead. Look for them in Asian markets and the refrigerated section of many grocery stores."
5001320~Green Beans with Pecan Pesto~1788~87~46~8~164~317~0~There will be more pecan pesto than you need for the beans, but it keeps well and can also be used on pasta, as a sandwich spread, or in potato salad.

Ask your butcher for a whole cured, smoked bone-in ham from the back leg of a pig, or order one from dartagnan.com (ask for the applewood-smoked bone-in whole ham). You can also buy a half ham and cut the recipe in half. Flavor the meat with Riesling from the same bottle you use to make the gelée for the chicken liver mousse .
5001329~Spiced Black Lentils with Yogurt and Mint~1333~189~59~52~34~1337~9~Aptly named beluga lentils look like little beads of caviar. They cook quickly, and they hold their shape. Use them in this recipe, or substitute.

5001334~Chipotle Braised Chicken~719~95~42~3~34~925~31~A straightforward stovetop braise makes this savory chicken just right for a weeknight. A little chipotle chile powder (left over from Pork Spice Rub ) gives the chicken a spark of heat, while lime juice and cilantro bring freshness to the cooking liquid. Serve this with Warm Herbed Coriander Rice Salad and your meal's complete.
5001335~Rhubarb-Cranberry Cobbler~7633~1603~1245~35~95~1333~271~For an elegant touch, serve the cobbler in oversize goblets and top with ice cream.
5001336~Coconut-Clam Stock~431~26~13~24~5~2832~74~The clams give up all their essence in this rich coconut-based stock. It's great for curries, or use it as the liquid base for a pot of steamed mussels or littleneck clams.

5001609~Sausage and Broccoli Rabe Frittata~1187~53~37~39~91~5143~473~The frittata will be easier to remove from the skillet if it sits for a few minutes—the top will deflate and the edges will pull away from the pan.

5001353~Steamed Mussels with Sausages and Fennel~2930~42~6~385~65~10923~1281~Most recipes for steamed mussels call for crusty bread on the side.

They look a bit different, but the end taste is the same, not to mention stacked enchiladas are a heck of a lot easier to make.

5001375~Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes~14619~2807~2470~134~398~3688~1465~Every October as kids, we loved to go pumpkin picking and buy fresh pumpkins. Our grandmother would take the pumpkin flesh and bake it in the oven with a little cinnamon and sugar, and then we’d stick it in the blender, puree it, and use it for baking. We’d bake pumpkin bread, pumpkin cake, and pumpkin pie, and we would also roast the pumpkin seeds in the oven. Really, she used every single part of that pumpkin! The thing we loved the most was our grandmother’s pumpkin cake. It was more of a cake-bread hybrid: very dense and savory yet sweet. It smelled amazing coming out of the oven. We would sometimes just eat it without any icing, hot from the oven. We’d burn our tongues because we wouldn’t even wait for it to cool!
5001376~Potato-Crusted Halibut Steaks~2661~272~57~45~135~10443~123~The following recipe can also be made with 1-inch-thick salmon fillets.

This mixture is eaten by hand and forms the first bites of the Sadhya. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.

By the twentieth century, this new version came to be called Manhattan clam chowder (some historians say that it was also called Coney Island clam chowder and Fulton Market clam chowder). It is believed that disdainful New Englanders named the red-stained chowder after Manhattan because they believed New Yorkers were the only ones crazy enough to add tomato to a pristine white chowder.

These are best served the day they are made for the crunchiest texture, but they are still yummy as the popcorn softens. It shouldn't be a problem though, since they take just minutes to throw together.
5001473~Red Flannel Hash with Dilled Sour Cream~1440~151~35~38~82~3232~21~Early in this century, fresh meat became a staple on many American tables. But old methods of flavoring and preserving beef-corning, for instance, which involved brining the meat with spices-remained popular. Often in New England, leftover corned beef simmered with vegetables would be chopped up and transformed into red flannel hash, so called because of the crimson color beets gave to the dish.

These days it's not too difficult to find great-quality raw salmon. If you ask your local market for sushi-grade salmon, its freshness will be guaranteed. Once you have found the salmon, the hard work is done.
5001606~Spicy Tamarind Shrimp~1326~174~30~26~48~17998~194~The best way to enjoy this Vietnamese delicacy is first to savor the sauce, shallots, and garlic tucked in and around the shells of the shrimp, then eat the succulent meat with steamed rice.

Like most people, I tend to have dessert as an occasional treat, rather than as a regular occurrence; these, however, I find almost impossible to resist. I like to eat them warm and steaming with thick cold cream—and sometimes a spoonful of warm honey, laced with grated lemon and orange zest.
5010691~Pickled Shrimp~3463~141~88~144~261~7496~1321~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but may require additional unattended time.

5001640~Chili and Honey Chicken Legs~261~20~14~15~15~3685~62~The chili powder used here can be found in most supermarkets and is made from a blend of spices — it is much milder than pure chile powder from New Mexico, which is very hot. These chicken legs pair nicely with the succotash.

5001646~Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Lime Syrup and Chives~906~46~34~1~78~1483~214~These sweet potatoes caramelize slightly in the oven, which gives them a sweet crunch as their flesh remains creamy. Lime syrup lends them addictive acid and tart notes, and fresh chives add a faint onion flavor.
5001648~Grilled Tuscan Pork Rib Roast with Rosemary Coating and Red Pepper Relish~979~156~121~24~18~4622~60~This technique works best with a charcoal grill, but you can also use a gas grill as long as it has a built-in thermometer or a hole in the top for inserting the candy thermometer.

5001658~Marzipan-Topped Strawberry Layer Cake~5998~530~328~105~385~1517~1116~"This cake, also called fraisier (French for ""strawberry plant""), is usually made with almonds, but pistachios are used in this rendition. The delicate cake is layered with fresh strawberries and a mousselike white chocolate buttercream and then topped with marzipan."
5001659~Scotch Broth~1918~214~110~66~93~47112~150~This speedy version of the long-cooked classic is light and brothy, but it's still substantial and flavorful enough — thanks to lamb, kale, and barley — to be a great winter meal.
5001660~Pecan Praline Topping~3015~166~129~44~248~195~4~Highly recommended!
5001661~Crunchy Eggs with Piquillo Peppers~3035~222~10~62~215~3258~386~"Chef Nancy Oakes was initially underwhelmed when developing this dish. ""The eggs were just poached and a little squishy,"" she says. ""Frying them in breadcrumbs made things more interesting."" For maximum crispiness, chill the poached eggs before giving them a pre-fry roll in the egg whites and panko."
5001662~Caraway-Crusted Pork Chops~591~84~79~21~15~91~79~Try the braised escarole with apples and the herbed spaetzle alongside these juicy chops.

5001667~Vegetable, Rice, and Lemon Soup~1127~215~19~35~16~7210~370~"""In our family we have a saying that the Greek kitchen is the original twenty-four-hour diner: It never closes,"" writes Georgia I. Chletcos of Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. ""The great thing about these home-style dishes is that they're generous to the cook and to everyone else: You don't have to be a pro to prepare them, there's always plenty to share, and you'll have a delicious meal on the table in no time."""
5001668~Oz Family Stir-Fried Rice~5641~889~70~215~133~3828~1260~This is a great meal to help you clean out your fridge. Use whatever veggies you have on hand! A cast-iron skillet will help the rice brown and fry to a crispy coating at the bottom of the dish.
5001670~Fiery Grilled Shrimp with Honeydew Gazpacho~854~88~65~99~11~8987~897~Cold soup and hot shrimp—this is a fantastic combination on a warm night. Blending the honeyed sweetness of this summer melon with intensely savory vegetables makes this dish incredibly refreshing. And I give the hot, spicy shrimp a hit of freshness by grilling finely sliced mint right onto them.

5008288~Chipotle Vinegar~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~Making chipotle vinegar is about as difficult as making a cup of tea. It is a fantastic tool to have in your repertoire when you want to add acidity with smoke in one easy pour. Use it in your favorite salads or anywhere you want to add smokiness.
5001673~Flour Tortillas~1119~196~0~87~59~1938~0~Highly recommended!
5001674~Bitter Greens with Carrots, Turnips, and Oranges~1219~106~76~24~78~592~0~The radicchio delivers nice color, but endive or escarole hearts would be smart substitutions flavorwise.

5017531~Lentils with Port-Glazed Shallots~930~202~20~101~13~0~0~A hearty combination of textures and flavors.
5001677~Sriracha Salt~10~2~1~0~0~93226~0~I can’t explain the sudden popularity of this chile sauce. It’s been around since the early twentieth century in Thailand, and has been available in the United States since 1980. The most popular brand in the U.S. is made by Huy Fong Foods, a company that was started by Vietnamese refugee David Tran. He named his company after the ship that brought him out of Vietnam. Also called “rooster sauce” because of the label design, demand has exceeded supply so much that Tran doesn’t need to advertise. If you have jumped on the Sriracha bandwagon, this is the salt for you. Use it on anything that could use a spicy punch— popcorn, fried potatoes, ramen noodles, grilled seafood, and sliced tropical fruits. I like to use a big ﬂaked salt for this one, but it works with any salt you choose.
5001678~Curried Trout with Chutney and Cucumber-Melon Raita~748~77~41~22~32~1282~131~Raita is India's signature yogurt and vegetable condiment. This one would also be good on pita or naan.

5016368~Pork Banh Mi with Quick-Pickled Radishes and Carrots~830~99~19~19~42~1441~63~The Banh Mi, arguably the greatest international sandwich, is easy to replicate at home. Letting the pickled radishes and carrots age a few days strengthens their tang and helps balance the rich pork.
5001681~Mixed Greens with Crispy Bacon, Goat Cheese, and Fried Egg~1731~53~3~95~128~3850~564~Serve with crusty French bread for a starter, light lunch, or supper.
5001682~Paprika Roast Chicken with Sweet Onion~370~15~5~15~28~1156~62~Cutting up a whole chicken is both economical and easy. (For a video of food editor Ian Knauer cutting up a chicken, visit gourmet.com.) Here, the pieces are simply tossed with spices and sweet onion before going into the oven.
5001683~Apple Cheese Wraps~849~20~6~44~63~2247~152~Highly recommended!
5001684~Baked Breaded Cauliflower~1561~70~22~67~112~2865~430~If there's a way to bake a vegetable, trust a Southerner to find it. Who else, pray tell, would steam a head of cauliflower, sauce it, bread it, and bake it? Note: To save time, I nuke the cauliflower, adding no additional liquid. The drops of water clinging to the head after it's washed are quite enough. I simply put the cauliflower in a 2 1/2-quart microwave-safe casserole deep enough to accommodate it, one with a tight-fitting domed lid. I then center the covered casserole in my microwave oven, set the cook-time at 14 minutes, and hit HIGH (full power). My microwave oven is a 650-watter; newer models of higher wattage will do the job faster—perhaps twice as fast. But you will know your particular model's prowess better than I. If you choose to steam the cauliflower instead, allow 8 to 10 minutes in a covered saucepan over moderate heat or until crisp-tender—there should be about 3/4 inch of water in the pan. No steamer rack needed. While the cauliflower cooks, ready the sauce and bread crumb topping. That way no time wasted. Tip: For mellower flavor and smoother sauce, substitute freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese for the Cheddar our mothers and grandmothers would have used.
5001685~Tortillas with Eggs~274~1~0~12~24~325~370~This dish is a twist on chilaquiles, a tortilla-based hash. It's great served with salsa for breakfast.
5018780~Mint Chutney~3282~665~431~19~61~300~7~Highly recommended!

5001691~A Rainbow of Grilled Peppers~647~83~0~8~28~673~0~If you can't get fresh oregano to sprinkle on the peppers, fresh basil or parsley is just fine.

5001699~Tuscan Porterhouse Steak with Red Wine-Peppercorn Jus~1040~33~0~33~77~6188~199~A porterhouse is the perfect steak for two to share because it contains good-sized portions of two of the most prized muscles in a steer, each located on either side of the center bone. The top loin, the larger of the two, is the same piece of gorgeous meat as that steakhouse staple, the New York strip. The tenderloin, attached to the other side of the bone, may be smaller, but it's a much larger portion (technically, it has to be 1 1/4-inches in diameter) than you get in a T-bone steak. If you can find dry aged, try it. It's a bit more expensive but yields more tender and flavorful meat. We pan-roast the steak with the Tuscan stalwarts of garlic, rosemary, and thyme, then serve it with a velvety red wine reduction.
5001700~Armagnac-Poached Prunes with Vanilla Ice Cream~2735~631~483~11~0~54~0~Highly recommended!

5004587~Beef Reduction~2753~330~186~116~116~63429~114~The reduction can stand in for some of the beef stock in French onion soup, pot roast, and beef stew, where it will add flavor and richness.
5001703~Panna Cotta~2335~15~7~107~212~495~747~Panna cotta, a molded chilled dessert popular throughout Italy, is easy to make and can be prepared in advance. It looks and tastes wonderful with ripe red fruits such as raspberries, strawberries, or sweet cherries.

5016974~Honey Caramel Peach Pie~1904~411~346~13~34~593~95~Any kind of mild honey will work beautifully here. It will cook into a rich caramel, which coats the peaches and deepens their sweetness.

5017326~Grilled Cuban Sandwich (Sandwich Cubano)~4766~64~32~359~362~12915~1230~Editor's note: Chef, nutritionist, and cooking teacher Lourdes Castro shared this recipe from her cookbook, Latin Grilling. It's part of a festive Cuban party menu she created for Epicurious and a great way to use up leftover grilled pork .
5001721~Broccoli-Cheddar Dip~2510~180~51~118~131~3384~430~This thick, cheesy dip is delicious with broccoli spears or bread sticks, or even as a spread on slices of bread. Serve any leftovers on baked potatoes or tossed with potato salad.
5001722~Cilantro-Yogurt Sauce~541~91~60~9~14~1042~46~This cooling raita, or yogurt sauce, is a popular condiment for Indian feasts. It's also great with lamb chops.
5001723~Eula Mae's Seafood Gumbo~3042~199~35~212~191~5908~1289~If you can, buy fresh shrimp with shells and heads still intact. If the heads have been removed, don't worry. Peel the shrimp and use the shells to make shrimp stock. Put the shells (and heads) in a small stockpot. Add 6 cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for about 1 hour. Remove from the heat, strain through a fine sieve, and set aside. If you don't have shrimp stock, water can be substituted.
5001724~Fig and Carrot Slaw~599~150~117~9~0~1333~0~Highly recommended!
5001725~Singapore Shrimp Stir-Fry~286~1~0~62~3~2302~543~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5001726~Strozzapreti with Spinach and Preserved Lemon~3171~403~50~75~135~3086~276~This bright, vegetarian sauce features lemon three ways: juice, zest, and preserved lemon peel.
5004505~Sweet and Chunky Apple Butter~3560~946~841~0~0~533~0~This fruit butter makes a quick dessert. It's also a great snack on bread or toast. We use it in a low-fat recipe for a moist and chunky apple butter spice cake. We have found preserving in half-pint (250 mL) jars convenient, since that recipe calls for that amount of apple butter. But if you use larger jars, you'll have lots left for other uses.
5001728~Lentils San Stefano~1645~283~69~46~48~5574~0~Santo Stefano di Sessanio produces some of the best lentils in Abruzzo. Small French lentils make a good substitute.
5001729~Casserole of Turkey with Rice~2393~400~33~107~34~7282~202~Highly recommended!
5001730~Pecan Pumpkin Pie~1889~338~261~21~48~932~471~Highly recommended!
5001731~Roasted Strawberry Trifles With Lemon Cream~6090~727~490~51~358~2440~1101~Roasting the strawberries intensifies their sweetness.
5001732~Honey-Gingered Pork Tenderloins~420~97~80~9~0~5965~0~"Each year, some fifteen thousand Iowans enter nearly fifty thousand things in competitions at the State Fair. Categories range from draft horses and monster trucks to quilts and corn-cob mosaics. Of course there are pies and cakes, breads and biscuits, jellies and preserves, plus contests for the ugliest cake, the most creative dough sculpture, and things you can do with breakfast cereal. In 1994 Emma Whitlock of Indianola took first prize in the ""Let's Cook Healthy! Iowa Pork"" category. Although this isn't a traditional Fair version of pork tenderloins, it's a simple way to give them a sweet twist."
5001733~Hot Spiced Buttered Rum~425~74~14~13~8~1656~10~Highly recommended!
5001734~Penne Vodka with Herbed Chicken~2196~377~16~72~44~1987~144~This sophisticated main-course pasta goes wonderfully with garlic bread, Italian-style mixed greens drizzled with vinaigrette, and raspberry gelato with Italian macaroons.
5001736~Red Velvet Cupcakes with Coconut and Cream Cheese Frosting~6106~918~735~121~215~477~876~"Brandi Neuwirth of Cary, North Carolina, writes: ""My family and I moved here from Los Angeles last year, and my new surroundings have really influenced my cooking. There's a great farmers' market nearby where I get lots of local ingredients. The produce there inspired me to create this dish, which is a real taste of the South."""
5001737~Grilled Radicchio and Kale, Sauerkraut Style~522~111~79~5~0~550~0~Kale and radicchio both do quite well on the grill; the direct heat turns their edges charred and crispy while the inner leaves become tender and stay intact. Soaking the kale is important so that steam can build and cook through the tough stalks as the leaves grill. Because kale and radicchio are both slightly bitter greens, they take to a sauerkraut-style dressing just as well as cabbage does.
5005637~Green Bean and Red Onion Salad with Warm Cider Vinaigrette~718~97~80~4~31~477~0~Highly recommended!
5001739~Apricot Galette~986~165~108~16~32~263~0~Serve this with sweetened whipped cream.
5001740~Tamales de Mole Poblano~5506~610~172~88~297~4852~136~This recipe is part of the Epicurious Online Cooking School, in partnership with the Culinary Institute of America. To watch it being made, and to learn how to make other Mexican classics, check out the video classes.
5001741~Raspberry and Blueberry Vanilla Cheesecake~5932~691~465~72~307~2144~783~Fresh raspberries and blueberries enhance both the filling and the topping of this creamy and delicious dessert. Begin preparing it a day before serving.
5003567~Rhubarb Chutney~2632~616~546~11~0~6~0~This recipe is an accompaniment for Baked Ham with Mustard-Red Currant Glaze and Rhubarb Chutney .
5001743~Flourless Chocolate-Hazelnut Cake~5990~531~399~65~426~2828~1211~Small wedges of this luscious, superchocolaty cake go a long way.
5001744~Black Bean Soup with Cilantro-Tomato Salsa~465~86~16~24~0~790~0~Begin preparing this a day before serving.
5001745~Oven-Dried Tomato Tart with Goat Cheese and Black Olives~2584~86~7~115~209~3002~687~Oven-drying the tomatoes before baking the tart concentrates their sweetness and prevents juices from softening the filling.
5001746~Meatballs in Tomato Sauce~954~149~25~14~28~4107~14~Serve these hearty meatballs over noodles or mashed potatoes.
5004415~Spicy Summer Rolls with Peanut Dipping Sauce~3130~463~293~83~118~6529~0~We like to think of the summer roll as an elegant example of fast food: a salad packed into an edible container—in this case, paper-thin rice sheets—which results in something as beautiful to behold as it is practical to eat by hand. Better yet, the summer roll is a big win for the health-conscious because the roll is almost fat-free, and the sauce, while sporting a little peanut butter, is not highly caloric. One dipped bite yields an explosion of flavors and textures that's guaranteed to excite any palate.
5010270~Pineapple Papaya Relish~1636~357~245~15~10~1310~0~"This recipe was created to accompany <epi:recipeLink id ""11847"">Grilled Teriyaki Pork Chops with Pineapple Papaya Relish</epi:recipeLink>.</a> Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time."
5001750~Broiled Fish Fillets with Basil Butter~802~33~0~0~69~2130~189~Serve with rice or boiled new potatoes.
5001751~Wild Mushrooms, Haricot Vert, and Shallot Sauté~981~66~16~18~64~3508~185~Highly recommended!
5001752~Shrimp Broth with Lemongrass, Chili and Ginger~775~100~66~75~4~1261~660~A combination of spicy, tangy and aromatic flavors, this light soup is also really satisfying.
5001753~Nach Waxman's Brisket of Beef~806~68~20~11~51~383~35~This is the go-to recipe for knowledgeable brisket lovers. Who then share it with others. Who share it with—perhaps—the Obamas and other notable families. So warm and welcoming, the secret is what Nach did way before anyone else: slice the meat midway through cooking. If you serve this the day after you make it, reheat, covered, for about 1 hour in a 325°F oven.
5001754~Baked Rigatoni alla Norma~6105~460~35~224~409~12555~245~Highly recommended!
5001755~Spicy Lemon Crab Cakes on Mixed Greens~1401~45~8~131~79~3419~485~These crispy cakes are jazzed up with cayenne and lemon peel. Add purchased potato salad, sliced tomatoes, and a seeded baguette. A strawberry tart from the bakery would make a refreshing summer finish.
5001756~Chicken and Hominy Soup~707~27~18~25~60~9246~62~This easy main-course soup is great on its own or with toppings, such as tortilla chips, avocado, and sour cream.
5013551~Roast Beef Stock~259~53~13~427~303~2520~1112~Homemade beef stock is richer and more flavorful than store-bought, adding lip-smacking depth to your soups, sauces, and braises. Freeze it by the quart and put it to work all winter long.
5001758~Crispy Kale Bars~2194~334~18~77~60~1204~0~Copious amounts of kale were sacrificed in my pursuit of a kale energy bar. On my umpteenth attempt at puréeing the leaves into gooey-green glue, inspiration struck: why not incorporate the kale in crispy kale-chip form? It only took one batch to know I had a winner. The trick to getting great bars is to make sure that the kale is super-crisp, which is a cinch so long as you dry the leaves thoroughly– I'm talking layers of clean dish towels or many turns in the salad spinner, a mere minute or two of effort, before baking. If water remains on the leaves, the kale will steam, not crisp. I don't know about you, but the prospect of steamed kale bars doesnt do it for me. But crispy, toasted seed-enhanced bars? Yes and yes!
5001759~Toasted-Pecan Pie~8315~1275~1034~62~385~3651~496~Toasting the pecans before adding them to the filling deepens the flavors in the pie.
5014967~Pumpkin Seed Pesto~3892~88~10~173~321~2399~10~Highly recommended!
5001761~Southwestern Barbecued Brisket with Ancho Chile Sauce~463~88~67~3~10~8080~0~Ancho chile powder gives the meat its southwestern flavor. Chef Purviance suggests serving the brisket with southwestern-style coleslaw (sliced cabbage, jicama, and red onions tossed in a red-wine vinaigrette) and black beans with corn, tomatoes, and chiles. Leftovers would make great sandwiches.
5016814~Self-Stomped Thick White Noodles~0~0~0~0~0~5816~0~_(Te Uchi Udon)
5001764~Stir-Fried Grains with Shrimp and Eggs~1767~152~11~47~100~2703~524~Make extra grains on Sunday and use them for this lightning-quick weeknight dinner.
5001765~Jalapeño Tequila Gimlet~393~98~93~0~0~1645~0~Forget the mezcal. Use this chile-infused tequila in Margaritas and Palomas—salt-rimmed cocktails made with tequila, lime juice, and grapefruit soda.
5001766~Mango Coconut Ice Cream~1416~212~193~17~57~601~189~In Thailand, mangoes often appear on the table for dessert — served both on their own and incorporated into a sweetened sticky rice. If you can't get your hands on really good mangoes, you'll find that canned mango purée delivers the best flavor for this ice cream. However, many canned brands taste like peaches, so we recommend Ratna brand, which uses Alphonso mangoes, an Indian cultivar renowned for its bright orange flesh and very intense flavor. Ka-Me brand is a runner-up — the recipe will work fine, but the color and flavor will not be as intense.
5001767~Warm Pear and Walnut Cake with Lemon Custard Sauce~4455~584~295~78~191~2711~755~Pears and walnuts are often seen growing side by side in wine-country orchards. They make ideal partners in this delicate, old-fashioned dessert.
5001768~Provençal Chicken and Tomato Roast~1266~142~35~32~57~5890~62~Here, chicken thighs and drumsticks roast on one side of a sheet pan while, on the other, a trio of tomatoes (plum, grape, and sun-dried) intensifies in flavor along with crusty potato and briny olives.
5013096~Brown-Rice Flour Mix~1741~360~2~35~15~23~0~Highly recommended!

5001772~Roasted Sea Bass with Tomato Coulis and Fennel Salsa~1459~61~50~23~127~234~49~Both the tomato coulis and the salsa can be made up to one day ahead.
5001773~"Tamarind ""Teriyaki"" Chicken Skewers"~541~72~22~21~17~553~89~Long before I discovered my love of sashimi, I fell in love with the viscous, sweet taste of teriyaki. With anywhere from 300 to 700mg of sodium per tablespoon, however, teriyaki chicken from the local takeout is now out of the question. So, to meet my cravings, I let go of the original dish and focused on finding a substitute with a similar color, thick coating, and unique flavor. The low-sodium answer lay in tamarind paste—a sweet and tart concentrate made from tamarind seed pods. It is popular in Indian, Middle Eastern, and East Asian cuisines, and can even be found in Worcestershire sauce. Its acidic properties help tenderize meat, and in Ayurvedic medicine it is said to have heart-protecting properties. Or in Western medicine speak, it may help lower bad cholesterol.
5001774~Spicy Sesame Noodle, Green Bean, and Carrot Salad~1163~183~81~31~45~2789~0~The dressing is packed with intense flavors, so only a limited amount of oil is necessary.
5001775~Potato Pierogi with Cabbage and Bacon~988~35~23~31~79~2774~178~In many parts of the country, pierogi, Eastern European dumplings, are sold fresh and frozen in supermarkets. Like premade egg rolls, they've become a convenience food for cooks with limited time. Served with the cabbage and bacon, they're all you need for dinner. These turnovers are typically deep-fried, or boiled and then panfried. Instead, we used a method often employed for cooking frozen Asian dumplings and found it works very well. If pierogi aren't sold in your supermarket, try a local Polish or Eastern European deli.
5003399~Green Chili Corn Bread~3367~415~92~77~75~4527~496~This recipe originally accompanied Smoked Chicken Salad on Toasted Corn Bread Triangles .
5001777~Sauteed Trout with Pecans~2050~143~75~50~165~1158~267~Highly recommended!
5001778~Chocolate-Dipped Orange and Ginger Florentines~1954~334~264~16~67~337~96~Chewy, candy-like caramel cookies enhanced with orange and crystallized ginger. The leftover orange sugar syrup is a delicious sweetener for hot tea.

5001784~Fried Custard Squares with Rum Sauce~3412~749~389~97~29~2233~440~Highly recommended!
5001785~Hoisin-Glazed Meatloaf Sandwiches~5142~516~131~186~214~14811~761~Delicious on its own, this thoroughly modern meatloaf takes on a terrine-like texture when chilled overnight, just right for deluxe open-face sandwiches with a <am>banh mi-like flavor profile.</am>
5001786~Melon, Arugula, and Serrano Ham with Smoked Paprika Dressing~870~28~5~15~79~1140~23~The smoked paprika in this recipe adds depth. Unlike Hungarian paprika powder, which is prepared by drying the chiles in the sun, the Spanish smoked version (like La Chinata brand) is prepared by roasting the peppers over smoldering oak fires before being ground to a velvety powder.
5001787~Amaranth and Feta Phyllo Triangles~1590~104~6~66~99~2489~634~With more flavor than spinach triangles and packed with vitamins, these quickly became such a hit in our house; we like this so much we double the recipe when we make it because no one can eat just one.
5001788~Potato, Leek and Onion Soup with Garlic Cheese Toasts~5004~646~109~182~186~37139~315~This rib-sticking soup makes a fine meal, especially with a salad alongside.
5017544~Mango Salsa~970~139~76~27~40~1530~0~Highly recommended!

5001792~Salmon with Parsley Cream Sauce~1208~46~6~0~80~1709~323~A sophisticated main course that's quick and easy to make. Accompany the fish with wild rice pilaf and steamed asparagus.
5001793~Turkey Albondigas Soup~757~101~25~60~10~9192~119~Pass hot pepper sauce and warm buttered tortillas to complete this easy dish.
5001794~Hotel Plaza~295~98~10~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5001795~Country Fried Steak Salad With Blue Cheese Dressing~2321~384~45~91~47~6207~422~We’ve given this comfort food classic a refreshing spin by serving it over snappy Little Gem lettuce. A double coating of batter helps keep the steak crispy, and a blue cheese-buttermilk dressing offers just enough tang. Add a batch of flaky, peppery biscuits and a restorative glass of iced tea and you’ve got a meal any Southerner would happily dig into.
5001796~To Stir-Fry Pea Shoots~420~33~0~0~29~0~0~Highly recommended!
5019558~Feta-Yogurt Sauce~73~12~9~4~0~79~4~This recipe is an accompaniment for Greek Herbed-Spinach Latkes with Feta-Yogurt Sauce.

5003755~White Bean Soup with Chive Oil~1453~209~48~45~56~3145~59~This creamy soup, served in tiny cups and bright with chive oil, is easy to make and serve. Kids will like the little cups and the crazy green swirl. Adults will appreciate the healthfulness and the flavor.

5001803~Chicken Lo Mein with Ginger Mushrooms~3022~383~96~122~111~11492~655~This recipe is extremely simple to make and has a nice peppery flavor from the red pepper flakes, white pepper, and ginger. There is a variety of fresh noodles in the refrigerator section of most Chinese food markets. The best noodles for lo mein are about 1/4 inch thick and are sold in 1-pound packages. If fresh shiitake mushrooms are not available, use button mushrooms. I will sometimes substitute bean sprouts for the Napa cabbage.
5001804~Tandoori Chicken~456~40~6~0~29~2088~0~Highly recommended!

5001808~Roasted Potatoes and Asparagus with Parmesan~2033~352~72~43~49~10087~0~We always look forward to fresh asparagus at the market. Roasting it with buttery Yukon Golds—and a handful of Parmigiano-Reggiano, of course—deepens the flavor.
5001809~Honey-Roasted Lamb with Arugula and Pine Nut Salad~1291~80~56~40~96~411~0~Here, lamb chops are presented atop a salad that was inspired by the flavors of Sardinia. A perfect first course or a light main course.
5001810~Smoked Fish Fritters with Beet Vinaigrette~2140~45~17~44~202~943~459~Smoked and fresh fish join forces in this much-appreciated update to the often-maligned gefilte fish. To get the job done faster, use two skillets.
5001811~Strawberry Cream Cheese Tart~6803~1084~629~101~218~1782~633~Make this tart the day before serving to give it enough time to set.

5001815~Balsamic Strawberries with Whipped Mascarpone Cheese~1281~104~104~4~89~63~304~Yes—vinegar and berries: The mellow balsamic, sweet strawberries, and rich mascarpone come together beautifully.
5001816~Kidney Bean Salad with Walnuts and Cilantro~3225~69~15~55~310~18~0~The great flavor of toasted cumin adds a nice dimension to this easy side dish. It's an extra step that is definitely worth it.

5015450~Slow-Cooked Veal Grillades~967~271~13~436~249~3216~900~Editor's note: Serve this veal with Chef John Besh's Jalapeño Cheese Grits .
5001824~Everyday Yellow Dal~328~17~5~3~28~1352~73~I’d like to clear up any confusion. Dal is not a soup. In fact, there is a dish called dal soup, and it’s different from the dal we’re talking about here. Think of dal as similar in use to gravy—in other words, not a side dish or its own course. It is eaten on rice or with flatbreads, or with dry curries, and vegetables; it is meant as part of a meal.
5014851~Harvest Tart~3249~361~97~139~216~2922~383~Brushing the pastry with egg adds shine while it bakes.
5001826~Black Olive and Goat Cheese Sandwiches~2784~128~51~102~214~7069~428~I can't think of a better sandwich to take along to the beach, enjoy next to the pool, or keep on hand in the fridge than these wraps. The combination of olives, goat cheese, frisée, and red pepper reminds me of the Mediterranean Sea, making any summer occasion seem slightly more exotic. Thanks to the durable flour tortillas, which can hold alot of heft and moisture without soaking through and tearing, these sandwiches can be made ahead of time.

""My recipe reflects the Caribbean influences in the foods of Miami, where I lived for many years."""
5001831~Sweet Potato Tart with Coconut Crust and Pecan Streusel~7688~825~447~186~497~6274~1313~This dessert has been the grand finale for every type of fancy dinner at Highlands, from museum balls we've catered to family Thanksgiving meals to nightly desserts. Buttery sweet potato filling, sweet coconut, and crunchy pecans combine with a dark rum crème anglaise to make a minor classic. This also pairs well with a cinnamon crème anglaise (see Variation).
5006550~Bacon-Cheddar Burgers with Caramelized Onions~3818~127~59~246~259~5574~882~"In our never-ending quest for the best burger, we think we've hit on an outstanding version that requires nothing more than a trip to the supermarket and a short sojourn in the freezer for the bacon. Sure, there are those DIY purists who are going to buy several different beef cuts from a high-end butcherif not butcher the beef themselves from their own grass-fed steerthen coarsely grind it with their own sterilized meat grinder, but most of us just want an easy recipe for a really great backyard burger.
Burger-meisters might be shocked, but this burger does best by being cooked a bit more slowly, over indirect heat. So sit back, pop open a cold one, and let these burgers baste themselves into a sublime place."
5001833~Fresh Herb, Potato and Leek Soup~5299~1026~209~105~66~34034~157~"A creamy ""comfort"" soup that has plenty of richness without a lot of cream."
5001834~Ricotta Puddings with Glazed Rhubarb~1244~125~103~35~69~1060~43~Delicate and creamy, these tender individual desserts taste equally good served warm or at room temperature. A spoonful of your favorite jam can be used in place of the glazed rhubarb.
5001835~Butternut Squash and White Bean Soup~1238~52~6~55~84~2241~89~Highly recommended!
5001836~Belgian Endive and Walnut Salad (Insalata Belga e Noci)~1534~51~32~19~147~2080~0~Crunch-crunch-crunch will end up as munch-munch-munch when this salad is served. Flavor is obviously crucial in food, and certainly this salad has flavor, but tactile sensation is also a very important factor in our food perception and appreciation. We want pasta al dente, celery crunchy, bread grilled. This salad has a lot of texture to enjoy.
5001837~Orange and Kiwi Compote with Toasted Almonds~735~116~108~6~16~91~0~Oranges and kiwis are among the fruits highest in calcium; almonds are the nuts with the most. This is a light and refreshing finish to any meal.
5001838~Cranberry-Port Gelatin with Crystallized Ginger and Celery~313~65~25~0~0~204~0~Highly recommended!
5017467~Ranch Dressing~1695~29~28~17~131~1625~194~"This recipe originally accompanied <epi:recipe link="""" id=""100982"">Confetti Salad with Ranch Dressing</epi:recipe>."
5001840~"""Cannoli"" Ice Cream Sandwiches"~1416~143~117~23~83~871~101~Highly recommended!
5001841~Bacon-Wrapped Trout Stuffed with Balsamic Onion Compote in Rosemary Cream Sauce~1803~65~60~32~160~3039~429~Highly recommended!
5007697~Stilton Dressing~98~3~1~1~8~78~0~Highly recommended!
5001843~Raspberry-Ricotta Cake~3445~469~287~116~178~3800~623~There's nothing like a moist, fluffy, berry-streaked cake to make any weeknight (or, um, weekday morning) feel special.
5001844~Vegetable Stir-Fry with Tofu~1535~94~23~47~91~5382~0~Highly recommended!
5016450~Spiced Herbed Nuts~432~30~30~0~34~3877~94~This particularly enticing version of the holiday favorite includes fresh rosemary and thyme along with the spices. The nuts can be made several days in advance and stored in resealable plastic bags in a cool, dry place.
5014860~Spicy Fried Chickpeas~92~15~0~4~1~1700~0~These irresistible nibbles are at their best served within minutes of deep-frying. If that seems like a little much for Thanksgiving dinner, you can fry them up to 4 hours ahead and warm them up in the broiler or microwave as your guests arrive. You could also serve them at room temperature, though they won't be quite as crispy on the outside and creamy in the center.
5001847~Turkish Zucchini Pancakes~1931~288~121~61~73~2572~569~Highly recommended!
5006847~Masa Stuffing~5042~818~6~88~157~8083~584~"This dense and savory stuffing resembles the filling inside a tamale. This recipe makes enough to stuff the <epi:recipelink id=""240455"">Mole-Roasted Turkey with Masa Stuffing and Chile Gravy, or to serve eight people when baked as a side dish.</epi:recipelink>"
5009667~Turkey Mole Sauce~3444~306~189~44~235~5439~10~Use this classic Mexican mole sauce to marinate the Mole-Roasted Turkey with Masa Stuffing and Chile Gravy . You'll be left with plenty of extra, which can be served alongside the turkey or frozen for later use. (Try it on turkey sandwiches, roasted chicken, or as a sauce for turkey or chicken tamales.)
5012921~Mole-Roasted Turkey with Masa Stuffing and Chile Gravy~897~18~0~8~92~6300~252~This gorgeous bird emerges from the oven nearly black and very deeply flavored. However, don't look for crisp skin; the mole keeps both the flesh and skin tender and moist.
5001851~Spicy Chicken Phyllo Rolls~1028~86~14~55~47~4155~72~Highly recommended!
5015458~Shallot Vinaigrette~351~38~30~0~20~1324~0~Highly recommended!
5001853~Wild Mushroom Frittata with Cheddar, Green Onions, and Peas~1916~129~23~53~127~3614~692~The beauty of a frittata is that it can be filled with just about anything, but the wild mushrooms in this one are especially delicious when combined with fluffy eggs and Cheddar cheese. To fill up the middle, I added green onions, peas, potatoes, and fresh thyme. It's actually easier to make this frittata than to go out to eat. Such a beautiful thing.
5001854~No-Bake Chocolate Kahlua Christmas Balls~2359~265~195~32~128~849~160~"Carole McCallum, Sammamish, Wash.
""Instead of Kahlúa, try Grand Marnier, crème de cacao, or another liqueur. For a festive touch, add green or red sprinkles."""
5001855~Pear and Raisin Crumble~6301~1045~531~73~202~1323~189~Highly recommended!
5001856~Crispy Pork Lettuce Wraps With Spicy Cucumbers~783~153~62~13~6~5552~10~Pork belly's back! Ask your butcher for a square piece: It'll make for even slices and a good fat-to-meat ratio.
5001857~Lamb Chops with Pomegranate and Dried Fig Relish~380~42~30~1~23~0~0~Look for sweet and flavorful pomegranate molasses at specialty foods stores and Middle Eastern markets.
5008005~Aromatic Yellow Rice~2619~504~118~35~33~5406~0~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5001859~Carrot Soup with Thyme and Fennel~1443~169~38~33~68~8084~126~Highly recommended!
5001860~Frozen Lemon Pie Pops~1102~43~40~7~104~339~336~Move over, ice pops: There's a new dessert making waves this summer. A blend of just four ingredients, these frozen pops are irresistibly creamy, with a sweet and tangy taste. Opt for our lemony take on this kid-friendly dessert, or substitute in Key limes, grapefruit, or orange for your own citrus twist.
5001861~Warm Milk Punch with Indian Spices~1312~258~256~11~7~320~28~Highly recommended!
5001862~Malted Vanilla Milk Shakes~1859~201~183~32~101~711~380~I am on a vanilla kick, and it can't be stopped. It should be noted that we are obsessed with malt, brewer's malt, malted milk balls, and the like. These milk shakes are so simple to make, and when we make them, people are always begging us for the secret ingredient. I suppose they aren't used to a malted milk shake anymore. So sad. Also, it makes me bonkers when people ask to use skim milk. It's just not as good, in my humble opinion.
5001863~Turkey Club Salad~943~33~14~63~57~3250~229~Thanks to precooked bacon and enhanced bottled dressing, this salad is a snap. For dessert, go all out with brownies à la mode.
5001865~Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes~6330~1121~232~119~143~30734~342~The tang of sour cream gives the illusion that this recipe is not as rich as the cream, butter, and milk would imply.
5001866~Goat Cheese Ravioli with Bell Peppers and Brown Butter~2196~163~22~61~150~4666~358~The restaurant uses house-made pasta, but wonton wrappers also work well (they're in the refrigerated deli section of most supermarkets).
5014390~Pineapple-Gin Punch~1821~315~303~0~13~187~0~Highly recommended!
5014113~Bourbon Punch with Pink Grapefruit and Mint~2704~261~155~171~108~5123~526~Highly recommended!
5014484~Green Tea and Citrus Whiskey Punch~6107~971~767~145~198~5322~473~Highly recommended!
5014440~Pomegranate-Champagne Punch~2378~432~165~35~54~1547~0~Highly recommended!
5001871~Sriracha Mayonnaise~1726~55~4~0~169~1759~253~We like the fruity heat of Sriracha, but if you have a different favorite hot sauce, go right ahead.
5001872~Buttermilk Waffles with Cherry-Almond Sauce~5127~559~265~92~123~1769~284~Topped with yogurt, these waffles make a great, filling breakfast; with whipped cream, they're perfect for dessert.
5001873~Caviar, Cream Cheese, Scallion, and Egg Towers~1120~26~14~31~94~1397~964~Highly recommended!
5001874~Pineapple-Rum Ice Cream~5719~764~728~23~274~431~975~Highly recommended!
5016631~Armagnac Toffee Sauce~2560~177~177~0~219~117~685~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5011366~Prune Kumquat Sticky Pudding with Armagnac Toffee Sauce~5439~1246~816~153~88~3521~585~The rich flavors in this moist cake intensify with a little bit of age. Though the Armagnac toffee sauce and Armagnac ice cream make festive partners, leftover cake is excellent served plain with tea or coffee.
5001877~Mixed Pulses and Herb Soup~2327~453~20~99~135~2695~168~Aash-e sholleh ghalamkar
5001878~Baked Ham with Mustard and Marjoram~1587~297~224~11~0~8562~0~Dijon mustard, brown sugar, marjoram, garlic and orange juice make a flavorful coating for this simple-to-prepare ham. The pan juices become a delicious sauce. Pour a Merlot with the meal.
5001879~Raisin Pie~3644~652~351~62~13~1259~21~Highly recommended!
5001880~Pear-Cranberry Turnovers~3032~668~376~21~28~367~0~Highly recommended!
5001881~Brussels Sprouts with Chestnuts~1039~9~2~3~117~1556~377~A touch of cream transforms this dish into a sumptuous side that exposes the luxurious character of this often homely vegetable.
5001882~Ricotta Tart with Dried-Fruit Compote~3630~382~193~93~178~6397~302~This gently sweet ricotta tart provides a creamy base to a rich compote of dried fruit, which includes figs, sour cherries, and apricots (we much prefer the tangy California kind over Turkish). It's much lighter than a cheesecake, but it hits all the right spots. The Miraglia family likes the tart chilled, but we also loved it at room temperature.
5001883~Asparagus and Swiss Cheese Souffles~530~24~1~15~39~1323~449~Crusty sourdough rolls and coleslaw made of shredded red and green cabbage tossed with a vinaigrette are nice with the soufflés. Afterward, have a caramel-nut tart from the bakery and cups of herbal tea.
5001884~Clams au Gratin~123~29~11~4~0~449~0~Nice, being by the sea, offers interesting fish dishes. One of these is poutargue, made with dried and smoked roe, which you will find in some delicatessen shops. The roe should be grated or finely chopped. To every 2 cups add 1 cup chopped hard-cooked egg, 1 cup finely chopped onion, a dash of lemon juice and enough olive oil to blend all.
5001885~Maghrebi Sweet Couscous (Seffa)~869~119~118~0~46~0~126~Residents of Maghreb use semolina to make tiny pasta pellets called kesksu in Arabic. Unlike pasta made with other types of wheat flour, pasta made from semolina does not become mushy during cooking. The old-fashioned way of making these pellets is to mix semolina flour with water, roll the dough into tiny balls, sift it over a medium-meshed wire sieve to remove any excess flour, then steam the final product over boiling water or a stew. Instant couscous, available at most supermarkets, is prepared by adding boiling water. Although not as fluffy as the classic type, it is more than acceptable for seffa and easy to prepare. Israelis make a larger form of couscous, which is lightly toasted; do not substitute for the regular type.
5001887~Roasted Root Vegetables with Apple Juice~2593~557~423~18~34~1650~94~This mixture of vegetables is subtly flavored with apple juice and wine.
5001888~Mussels in Saffron and White Wine Broth~3576~59~13~518~97~11152~1752~This recipe is one of the simplest and most delectable recipes in the book. The flavor of the mussels pairs beautifully with the unique flavor that the saffron imparts to the broth. You will find yourself making this recipe again and again.
5001889~Broiled Grouper Fillets with Romesco Sauce~1020~89~4~8~69~1810~0~With boiled potatoes and grilled vegetables, you have an easy dinner. Lemon sole or red snapper could be substituted for grouper. The sauce—our take on a Spanish classic—can also be used as a dip for vegetables or to spread on grilled bread.
5001890~Meringue-Topped Baked Grapefruit~663~165~162~9~0~198~4~Active time: 45 min Start to finish: 1 hr
5001891~Radicchio with Smoked Mozzarella, Balsamic Vinegar, and Prosciutto~976~9~1~64~82~2953~139~Highly recommended!
5001892~Beer-Battered Catfish on Vinegar Slaw~189~17~16~0~14~969~0~Make this a new version of Britain's fish and chips with (frozen) steak fries. Lemon tarts from the bakery would be good for dessert.
5001893~Beef Pot Stickers~1075~174~0~102~48~1407~74~Garlic chives smell more pungent than they taste and are wonderful when cooked. (Keep them wrapped well in your refrigerator.)
5001894~Bittersweet Chocolate Pecan Bourbon Cake~5194~526~451~70~346~2044~870~Highly recommended!
5001895~Scallop-Stuffed Pickled Peppers~399~15~0~72~3~2490~140~Highly recommended!
5001896~Penne with Yau Choy~1431~117~8~42~84~4289~115~Active time: 35 min Start to finish: 45 min
5001897~Turkish-Style Tomato and Red-Pepper Spread~1393~93~2~10~110~660~0~Opening a can of tomato paste just to use a tablespoon or two for a recipe can be something of a drain on one's culinary resources—do you ever remember to use the rest of the can? This recipe is the delicious solution. Leftover tomato paste (from our Sausage–Stuffed Potatoes with Green Salad) gets puréed with roasted red peppers, walnuts, and garlic to become a luscious, deeply flavored spread. This easy recipe makes a lot, so it's perfect for a party. And it's so good that it's even worth cracking open a fresh can (it will taste just fine if you use the whole thing).
5001898~Chicken in Red Wine Sauce with Root Vegetables and Wilted Greens~3314~100~29~176~231~7294~618~Here's an updated coq au vin that's from Fringale in San Francisco.
5011984~Cranberry and Candied Orange Chutney~2042~481~459~4~2~386~0~Highly recommended!

5001903~Holiday Date-Nut Cookies~12339~1290~708~236~690~4839~876~Highly recommended!
5001904~Poached Arctic Char with Basil-Tarragon Mayonnaise~1818~40~4~11~165~11828~4~This herbaceous aioli is also terrific spooned over simply prepared vegetables, such as boiled new potatoes or roasted ramps.
5001906~Chocolate Cranberry Cakes with Bourbon Whipped Cream~3377~422~350~27~188~537~761~These luscious cranberry-studded cakes enriched with bourbon and pecans break away from traditional pumpkin pie without eliminating all those beloved ingredients that say Thanksgiving.
5001907~Roast Turkey with Savory Cranberry Sauce From the Titanic~6681~1244~30~209~100~22166~203~By the turn of the century, the North American turkey had become familiar British fare, replacing the traditional goose at many an English Christmas table. Here it is presented in classic American style with bread stuffing and accompanied by cranberry sauce, which at this period was more like a sauce than a preserve.
5001908~Cornmeal Cake with Buttermilk Ice Cream and Rhubarb Compote~3550~550~285~48~124~2112~623~A little cornmeal gives the cake a crunchy texture. The sweet-tangy ice cream and the tart compote help dress up the dessert for this holiday dinner.
5001909~"Scallop Ceviche with ""Tiger's Milk"""~1821~200~64~84~65~2196~140~In a country known for its fascinating, wide-ranging cuisine, ceviche just may be Peru's national dish. Combinations of sparklingly fresh raw fish marinated in a piquant dressing (often made with ají amarillo and lime juice) are served everywhere, from the lowliest fish shacks to the finest restaurants. For food-safety reasons, we choose to gently poach the scallops, but otherwise, this version, accented by tender sweet-potato cubes, chewy kernels of choclo (a type of Andean corn), and red bell pepper, is entirely classic. Don't forget to drink up the delicious liquid that remains after the ceviche has been eatenPeruvians prize this leche de tigre as a hangover cure.
5001910~Artichoke Croustades~938~55~3~10~73~785~151~Highly recommended!
5001911~Lemon Fettuccine with Asparagus and Salmon Caviar~1185~65~3~38~79~1650~279~The pasta and sauce cook simultaneously (so two cooks can divide and conquer), for a total of about ten minutes, start to finish. Serve with your best bottle of bubbly.
5001912~Pork Wrapped in Sage and Prosciutto~594~2~1~45~43~3124~143~Highly recommended!
5001913~Scrambled Eggs with Avocado, Onion, and Cheddar~1195~11~5~12~120~1029~391~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5001914~Nectarine and Blueberry Clafouti~1650~234~172~41~76~387~561~We admit we've never been big clafouti fans, but this recipe won us over. It's the lightest version of the dish we've ever had. In the fall and winter, innkeepers Bob and Caroline Taylor like to make this dessert with pears, flavoring it with powdered ginger.
5001915~Mashed Potato and Butter Bean Cakes with Green Onions~3558~705~116~83~36~13449~77~Serve as a side dish or as an appetizer.
5001916~Tropical Lime Torte with Mango Compote~1156~220~206~14~30~140~370~Check the supermarket produce section for fresh peeled and sliced mangoes. You'll need about four cups of diced mangoes.
5001917~Spaghetti with Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Lemon, and Chives~3541~414~22~161~116~84214~238~Don't let the simplicity of this pasta dish fool you — it's packed with irresistable springtime flavors.
5001918~Okra Caponata Toasts~1195~223~3~21~20~948~0~Okra replaces the usual eggplant in an innovative and appealing appetizer.
5001919~Mâche and Avocado Salad with Tortilla Strips~764~99~8~55~15~2200~0~Highly recommended!
5001920~"Fruit Juice ""Gummies"""~513~133~123~0~0~52~0~The tiny florets here are made from peach, pear, and guava nectar, but you can use any fruit juice you like except pineapple, kiwi, and papaya, which won't gel properly.
5001921~Rib-Eye Tacos with Onion Jam and Horseradish Crème Fraîche~2997~176~64~177~183~9309~501~Although Bonfire is known for its meat dishes prepared in various global styles, the restaurant's taco bar is where the small plates trend is stoked.
5017688~Swiss Chard with Horseradish~709~72~20~30~44~4309~0~If you're trying to incorporate more dark leafy greens into your meals, Swiss chard is a great starter vegetable. It cooks quickly compared to kale and collards, and the stems are as delicious as the leaves. In fact, the stems are the prized portion of the plant in Provence, and that's not something kale or collards can brag about.
5001923~Crystallized-Ginger Spice Bars~2938~606~298~141~78~2562~218~Highly recommended!
5001924~Classic Chocolate Egg Cream~264~51~43~4~3~196~14~The name egg cream is misleading—in actuality, the soda fountain classic contains no eggs and no cream. The three winning elements are milk, flavored syrup, and seltzer. For an icy beverage like top soda jerks used to craft, it's best to frost glasses in the freezer.
5001925~Frozen Italian Zabaglione Tart with Marsala-Lemon Sauce~2590~496~471~19~73~229~162~Zabaglione, the Italian custard made of egg yolks, Marsala and sugar, is used as a frozen filling for a crunchy macaroon crust.
5014957~Summer Strawberry Jam~2018~517~463~13~0~0~0~Almost any berry, or combination of berries, can be substituted in this recipe.
5001927~Goat Cheese with Chile Morita and Piloncillo Sauce~3280~262~251~41~241~25678~769~Highly recommended!
5001928~Corn, Tomato and Bean Salad~2230~398~13~48~52~561~0~This lively salad adds color, flavor and crunch to any grilled main course.
5001929~Date-Pecan Bourbon Truffles~4177~472~393~49~254~1538~200~Highly recommended!
5017921~Raspberry-Almond Linzer Cookies~737~21~5~26~64~361~0~The Linzer cookie, thought to have originated in the city of Linz, is based on the Linzertorte, one of the most famous and beloved confections in Austria. The cookies are like mini versions of the torte, which consists of a buttery dough, rich with ground almonds or hazelnuts, spread with jam—usually raspberry or apricot these days, but originally with black or red currant jam or jelly—and then topped with a lattice of more dough before baking.
5001931~Chicken Marinated in Garlic, Chilies and Citrus Juices~1313~44~5~12~123~1064~370~Highly recommended!
5001932~Papaya Poached in Cinnamon-Lime Syrup~1387~336~336~0~0~0~0~Fruit simmered in cinnamon syrup is a typical after-dinner treat throughout Mexico.
5011308~Cucumber Salad with Mustard Dressing~48~2~1~0~0~5400~0~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional sitting time.
5001934~Spaghetti with Anchovy Olive Sauce~2083~389~0~32~37~2661~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5001935~Small Pear and Almond Cakes~4569~432~283~94~287~1230~599~Muscat-poached Seckel pears are tucked into moist almond cakes for a charming dessert. Besides being cute, these tiny cakes leave guests room for pumpkin pie.
5001936~Scrambled Egg, Potato, and Bacon Tostadas~1665~34~5~49~144~1837~709~Highly recommended!
5001937~Key Lime Pudding Cakes~1107~60~26~42~83~556~492~Pudding cakes are little culinary marvels. Take what is basically a thin cake batter, fold in whipped egg whites, put the batter into a baking dish (or several ramekins as I do here), and voilà! As it bakes, the batter separates and forms a sponge cake on the top with a thick, kind of custardy pudding on the bottom.

5001978~Lamb Bacon~166~44~44~0~0~32957~0~Noah: We're always looking for alternatives to pork at Mile End, and this dry-cured lamb breast was an amazing meat discovery for me. You can use lamb bacon in pretty much any dish you'd use standard bacon or pancetta for: Italian peasant soups, potato salads, meat braises, pasta dishes, whatever. We finish our lamb bacon in a smoker, though at home I've cooked it in the oven and gotten great results; it just has a milder flavor. You can store the bacon in the fridge for many weeks.

5015634~Buffalo Prime Rib with Orange Balsamic Glaze~992~119~61~35~43~22932~48~Buffalo meat can be very red, even when cooked to medium-rare. Don't be alarmed — this is a naturally occurring phenomenon that has to do with the animal's diet and how little fat is marbled through the muscle. While testing this recipe, we learned that buffalo meat varies in quality; the purveyors whose meat we like best are Wild Idea Buffalo Company (866-658-6137; wildideabuffalo.com), Jackson Hole Buffalo Meat Company (800-543-6328; jhbuffalomeat.com), Arrowhead Buffalo Meats (877-283-2969; arrowheadsteaks.com), and D'Artagnan (800-327-8246; dartagnan.com).

5001992~Teriyaki Black Cod with Sticky Rice Cakes and Seared Baby Bok Choy~1472~290~108~34~12~7350~13~A staple of classic Japanese cooking, teriyaki is wonderful with not only seafood but also poultry, beef, vegetables, and tofu. Often, however, this versatile sauce can be quite sweet. My version uses fresh orange juice, which adds just a touch of natural sweetness as well as some acidity to temper the sweet mirin. Pouring some of the teriyaki sauce into the hot pan with the fish further reduces it so the sauce really coats the fish with a deep, caramel glaze that enhances the delectable moist, buttery, and tender qualities of black cod perfectly. Other good fish for this dish are Alaskan cod, true cod, sablefish, or wild salmon. Searing each side of the sticky rice cake gives a nutty flavor and crisp texture. I also like to serve these rice cakes with vegetable stir-fries in place of plain rice. If you have a rice cooker, use it to prepare the rice according to the manufacturer's directions. If not, follow the instructions in the recipe to prepare it in a saucepan.
5001993~Scalloped Squash, Red Pepper, and Corn Gratin with Cheddar Crust~5451~536~166~156~296~8177~705~A creamy white cheddar cheese sauce makes this gratin luxurious enough to serve as a vegetarian main course.

5001996~Trenette with Pesto, Potatoes and Green Beans~3722~342~17~140~207~6125~176~Basil is one of the favorite ingredients of the Italian region of Liguria, and there is no place in the world where it is more fragrant or put to such delicious use. It's the basis of the classic Genoese sauce, pesto, in which it is partnered with garlic, olive oil, pine nuts, and Parmesan and Pecorino Romano cheeses. It shows up most typically floating atop minestrone, drizzled over potato gnocchi, or - as here - tossed with trenette (the local ribbon pasta), potatoes and green beans.
5001997~Lox and Melon with Chives and Lemon~734~117~114~0~30~813~0~This simple appetizer is a clever blend of sweet, salty and tangy flavors.

5002028~Golden Delicious Apple and Cheddar Turnovers with Dried Cranberries~2684~163~103~109~180~2818~383~Golden Delicious apples hold their shape even when baked at a hot temperature and wrapped in puff pastry. Their honeyed flavor adds just the right amount of sweetness to balance these slightly savory turnovers.

5002030~One Pot Clam Bake~9139~1060~268~619~427~46620~2299~Serve this no-frills feast with cold beer and bowls of melted butter and steaming broth for dipping. The broth cleans the clams, particularly steamers, of any stubborn grains of sand. To serve 4, halve the recipe and divide ingredients equally between two large (8-10 quart) pots.
5002031~Mole Cake with Cherry-Almond Ice Cream, Tamarind Anglaise, and Orange Caramel~9876~1101~990~101~592~5234~1816~The name of this cake derives from the flavors that are reminiscent of the classic mole, an aromatic, delicious chocolaty savory sauce that originated in Pueblo, Mexico. I have always thought that dried chiles were a surprisingly good match for chocolate, and with the addition of canela, cloves, and pumpkin seeds, the full mole flavors emerge. For a shortcut, substitute sectioned grapefruit for the orange caramel.
5002032~Steak Burritos with Monterey Jack Cheese~2178~60~22~106~176~5230~379~You can also make these with chicken, ham or roast pork.

5002034~Cranberry-Apple Crumble Pie~5752~796~476~113~317~1287~642~It's easy to understand why apple crumble pie (sometimes called French apple pie in diners and old cookbooks) is so immensely popular: It packs all the flavor and fragrance of a traditional apple pie underneath a carapace of nutty, buttery, cinnamony crumbs. Adding cranberries to the filling evokes a familiar fall color and provides pleasant tartness to balance the sweetness.
5002035~Turkey-Chipotle Chile~992~49~19~115~35~47842~284~When you crave something hot and filling, a bowl of this chili will do the trick.

5002051~Walnut and Pancetta Pansoti with Asparagus in Parmesan Broth~1113~41~17~24~96~1384~0~"The plump ravioli called pansoti (""little bellies""), a Ligurian specialty, are often dressed with a walnut sauce. We strayed from tradition a bit and tucked the walnuts into the filling instead. Be sure to buy pancetta that's well marbled: If it's too lean, it won't render enough fat to flavor the filling. Also, brown the onions well — the caramelization lends a depth and richness that's essential to this dish."
5002398~Spiced Basmati Rice~1746~375~3~33~12~2624~31~The bay leaves give a faint flavor akin to allspice, and the cinnamon stick contributes its own subtle note.

5002054~Blueberry–Chia Seed Jam~836~156~105~14~25~95~0~Don’t worry if this looks a little runny when it’s hot. The chia seeds will plump as the jam cools, thickening it considerably.
5002055~Mango Pomegranate Guacamole~564~96~53~8~16~310~0~Folding fruit into guacamole is an inspired tradition in Mexican cooking.

5002134~Slow-Cooker Macaroni and Cheese~2715~216~45~141~141~3722~429~Move over boxed mac and cheese; this version is just as simple and a whole lot tastier. The recipe is adapted from the food section of the San Diego Tribune. Pasta in the slow cooker is a bit of a challenge since there must be enough liquid to cook the pasta, but not so much that it will get mushy. We love this recipe because it is the old-fashioned mac and cheese, without a heavy white sauce to make first. The combination of the evaporated milk and egg replaces the flour as the thickener; canned milk does not curdle as fresh milk–based sauces sometimes do. Kids love the macaroni shape, so resist substituting any other shape of pasta. Please note that the pasta goes into the cooker uncooked. This recipe can be doubled and cooked in the large cooker.

5002148~Stir-Fried Noodles with Fresh and Baked Tofu~969~99~56~30~46~6064~10~You'll need a big wok or two skillets to hold this large stir-fry. Here's a recipe where you can put that very dense, baked tofu to good use. Choose tofu that's been flavored with star anise or five-spice powder, available in natural food stores.

5002181~Berry Spinach Salad  With Toasted Hazelnuts~1430~149~89~21~85~2624~2~If you love sweet and salty paired in one dish, then this nourishing salad is for you. To take this dish on the road, pack the berries and the dressing separately to avoid wilting the greens. For a cocktail party, swap the greens out for lettuce cups and spoon them full of the carrots, radishes, berries, and nuts, then drizzle with dressing.
5002182~Chili Cornmeal Muffins~4602~573~77~100~132~4264~623~Corn kernels and chili powder lend a southwestern accent to these muffins. They would also be nice alongside a bowl of chili.

Mohammed also shared some helpful tips exclusively with Epicurious, which we've added at the bottom of the page.

5002190~Peppered Pork Loin with Beet and Leek Purée~1715~360~79~34~8~10317~0~Highly recommended!
5002431~Sea Scallops with Ham-Braised Cabbage and Kale~1345~121~42~23~76~4609~0~This dish — the result of a conversation between two food editors who had just returned from opposite parts of the country — almost made itself. Paul Grimes came back from Charleston talking about the creamy stone-ground grits, shrimp, and collard greens of chef Kevin Johnson at Anson, and Kemp Minifie returned from Seattle to tell us about the scallops over braised cabbage with foie gras vinaigrette that Johnathan Sundstrom serves at Lark. We loved the idea of both dishes so much, we met somewhere in between, with this simpler recipe.
5002192~All-Day Slow-Cooker Cassoulet~2961~146~19~87~219~14223~395~Last year I made this traditional French country casserole for a Super Bowl party. As a result, my sons will always think of it not as the legendary Languedoc amalgam of beans and meats that has inspired endless recipes, but as the classic Super Bowl gut-buster. They’re right. Cassoulet is peasant food, built to assuage hunger so completely that no amount of labor or hardship could dent the cloud of contentment it generates. And though foodies may argue about authenticity and the precise balance of meat to beans, and whether breadcrumbs belong on top, the truth is, a cassoulet is made from whatever you have on hand. Mine has white beans, lamb, garlic sausage, and smoked sausage (and breadcrumbs), but you can make yours with pork or ham, goat, or duck. Whatever you use, keep the proportions similar to those listed below, and you can’t lose. Go Eagles!
5012857~Eggplant, Tomato, and Fontina Pizza~1432~108~47~35~93~4162~61~Heat the pizza stone and prepare the eggplant and other pizza toppings in this recipe while the pizza dough is rising.
5003295~Rack of Lamb and Roasted Cabbage with Cauliflower and Date Purees~337~0~0~0~37~2908~63~This dish features cabbage and cauliflower prepared simply, to preserve the purity of their flavors. The dates bring out the inherent sweetness of both vegetables perfectly. Make the purées first, then roast the cabbage and cook the chops.
5002195~Caesar Potato Salad with Grilled Red Onion~3947~714~140~84~70~21248~44~Great with: Grilled rib-eye steak.
5002196~Seafood in Celery Root and Lovage Broth~5338~709~36~128~247~4950~596~What the New Sammy's menu describes as a broth is really a purée. The dish is somewhat monochromatic, but its fascinating flavor spectrum will make your mouth extremely happy.
5002197~Red Lentil and Tofu Curry~1081~123~5~45~41~1924~0~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5002198~Ham and Peach Kebabs with Marmalade-Mustard Glaze~518~62~51~0~29~509~0~There's a southern accent to this entrée, so round out the menu with corn muffins, coleslaw and three-bean salad; then bring on the coconut layer cake.
5002199~Slow-Cooker Cuban Pulled-Pork Panini Sandwiches~1130~105~50~17~75~3399~162~Cuban pulled pork—or lechon asado—meets traditional Cuban ham and Swiss sandwiches in these zesty, melty paninis. The pork absorbs loads of flavor while slow cooking in a garlic- and citrus-infused mojo sauce, which ultimately makes for one amazing hot sandwich. Unless you live in south Florida, Cuban bread will probably be rather difficult to come by. So use whatever type of bread tickles your fancy, and if you can’t find a loaf that measures 2 feet (61 cm) long, two smaller loaves (about 12 ounces [340 g] each) of Italian or French bread, or even individual hoagie rolls, would work beautifully instead. Just make sure to start and end your sandwich layers with Swiss, since the cheese is what ends up holding together an otherwise messy panini.
5008665~Cucumber-Dill Sauce~406~21~14~8~31~1922~20~Highly recommended!
5002201~Veal Saltimbocca (Saltimbocca alla Romana)~1591~0~0~28~166~2608~219~This recipe is part of the Epicurious Online Cooking School, in partnership with the Culinary Institute of America. To watch it being made, and to learn how to make other Italian classics, check out the videos.
5002202~Curried Beef Samosas with Mango-Papaya Chutney~1928~343~214~47~48~5240~35~Wonton wrappers are used for these samosas instead of traditional pastry dough. Betelnut Pejiu Wu in San Francisco serves them with a tropical chutney.
5002203~Avocado Soup with Herbs, Slivered Radishes, and Pistachios~2594~156~134~62~42~2080~36~Avocado pureed with buttermilk (low-fat) and yogurt (with the cream on top) yields a pale green soup laced with masses of minced herbs, textured with cucumber, and garnished with slivered radishes, herbs, and green pistachios. All in all, it's a fine soup for a hot day, and although the recipe makes just a scant quart, it will be enough for four or more servings.
5002204~Mustard-Crusted Pork Loin With Apple–Cabbage Slaw~1364~175~126~31~58~6453~85~During Easter time in Ireland, I love to whip up this easy dish for my family. My mom always has three other types of meat in the oven, usually a duck, a goose, and a turkey. Sometimes beef, too. So trying to find the space to make this meat ends up in an annual argument. Every. Single. Time. Just a snippet of Easter with the O’Keeffes.
5002205~Tagliatelle with Duck Ragù~909~48~5~55~47~2893~145~The secret to making this dish so stunningly delicious is duck fat. Puréeing the sauce emulsifies the fat, which, along with the moist duck meat, adds an irreplaceable element of richness.
5002206~Catfish with Herbed Lemon Cream~639~48~1~4~43~969~117~Pick up some crunchy coleslaw and corn bread to go with the fish. Bourbon-spiked sweetened peaches with vanilla ice cream are a nice dessert.

5002211~Tarragon Lobster Roll~903~95~55~7~54~377~110~Nilou Motamed, Epicurious Editor-in-Chief, swears by this herb-infused lobster roll recipe inspired by her father-in-law Michael DePorte. When available, Nilou prefers soft-shell lobsters, or shedders, for their easy-to-crack shells (no tools required!) and sweet, tender meat. If you choose soft-shell lobsters, reduce the cooking time by 2 to 3 minutes. She also prefers filtered seawater as a cooking liquid, so if your fishmonger has it available, give it a try! Boiling lobsters in well-salted water is the next best thing.
5002212~Roast Pork Loin With Rosemary and Garlic~720~33~0~0~27~3964~0~Butterflying the pork loin isn't difficult, but many butchers will do it for you.
5002213~Sauteed Carrots and Red Bell Peppers~326~33~9~11~15~720~10~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5002215~Curried Chicken Salad Pita Sandwiches~2705~160~38~132~195~9328~569~These healthy sandwiches get a kick from the curry powder. Serve with: Potato chips, red grapes, and a rice wine-marinated cucumber salad.
5014672~All-Butter Pastry Dough~1471~254~9~109~78~1454~214~Buttery, flaky, quick—this dough has it all. See cooks' note, if you need to halve the recipe to make the plum-blackberry streusel pie .
5002217~Crab and Roasted Red Pepper Strata~7247~953~126~396~202~17035~1303~A strata can be refrigerated overnight before being baked, so it's perfect for entertaining.
5002218~Pork Rib Satays with Peanut Sauce~2596~89~45~203~151~9726~753~"Pork ribs become satays with built-in ""skewers."" Great as party appetizers, the ribs can be made a day ahead, then grilled or broiled just before you serve them."
5002219~Francis Butler's Texas Tamale-Stuffed Turkey~680~85~24~21~22~1714~54~"Francis Butler grew up on the family ranch and continues to preside over the dry, windy land. The lonesomeness of ranch life, she says, was offset by ""group cooks"" such as the annual Thanksgiving tamale making: ""Wild turkey hunting has been a West Texas sport for as long as anybody remembers, and tamale-stuffed turkey may have been an early tip of the hat to the Mexican ranch hands who've been around for at least as long as the turkey. This recipe dates back to the early 1900s. I got it from a family whose grandmother was German but had been raised in Mexico. I make it most often in the cold months, but I've been known to put a tamale-stuffed turkey in the roasting pit in my time, as well. You can use commercial tamales, of course, but I like the two-day ritual of making tamales and then making the turkey. I always double or triple the tamales and freeze the extra. These days people use more barnyard turkey than they do wild. Before you go thinking that's a sorry thing, let me tell you this. You feed your chickens or turkey some chile peppers before you decide. That spicy sweet flavor gets into the meat and you know what they mean when they say it doesn't get any better."""
5014579~Spiced Red Wine with Brandy and Citrus~1013~184~181~4~30~1181~0~"The French often serve flavored wine as an aperitif. This one has a base of red wine infused with orange, lemon, vanilla and cloves; it is later mixed with raspberry brandy and sugar. The drink is best at cool room temperature, accompanied by nibbles such as olives, almonds and crudités. It also makes an excellent Christmas present  — just double or triple the recipe, and pour the drink into pretty bottles. Be sure to begin the ""winemaking"" process at least three weeks before you plan to have the wine or give it as a gift."
5002221~Creamy Celery-Root and Haricot Vert Salad~3280~232~54~34~246~2260~126~Thin green beans add ribbons of color as well as bite to a celeriac rémoulade.
5002222~Moroccan Beet Leaf or Swiss Chard Salad (Salade de Blettes)~189~37~1~2~0~180~0~MOROCCAN COOKS USUALLY MAKE this tasty salad with Swiss chard, but I have seen it also with beet leaves. Eaten all year round, it is prepared by Moroccans on Rosh Hashanah for their Sephardic Seder, when they say a series of blessings over squash, leeks, dates, pomegranates, black-eyed peas, apples, the head of a fish or a lamb, and Swiss chard and beet greens.
5002223~Baked Rigatoni with Sausage and Mushrooms~21021~1845~158~1465~898~52045~1900~The pasta is divided among four 3 1/2-quart baking dishes so they can be baked individually for open-house-style serving. But you can use any size bake-and-serve dishes — even a roasting pan or a paella pan.
5002224~Coconut-Crusted Mahimahi with Pan-Roasted Garlic, Rosemary, and Tomato Sauce~1480~127~15~33~110~378~4~In this simple, fresh-tasting dish, a crisp coconut coating keeps the fish moist and gives it real island flair. Chef Roxanne Russell grates and dries her own fresh coconut to get long, beautiful strands, but any grated dried coconut will do.
5008949~Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting~5729~1259~848~121~70~2116~75~2 x 3-inch piece per serving

5002228~Faux Tart with Instant Lemon Ginger Custard~1052~106~70~5~70~374~157~I was at Palena, my favorite restaurant in Washington, at the end of a meal, when the dessert's taste and texture made me gasp. It was a shallow lemon custard, not just silky but crystal clear in its flavor: a blast of just lemon, cream, and sugar in one bite. Pastry chef Aggie Chin explained that it's her take on a posset, a traditional English dessert in which the cream softly sets with nothing but the help of the acid from the lemon juice. I knew I'd try this at home. It makes the perfect topping for the cookie-crumble crust I like to make, and the perfect base for the fruit I like best with lemons: berries. This can be easily doubled when you'd like to make dessert for two nights in a row, or for you and a friend to share.
5002229~Cannellini and Fennel Salad with Roasted Peppers, Mushrooms, and Zucchini~1285~120~38~38~69~2410~44~A stunning vegetarian platter.

5002231~Margarita Chiffon Cake~6050~1195~776~84~118~4179~8~Californian Harry Baker invented the chiffon cake in 1927, but he kept the recipe a tightly guarded secret for another 20 years. He finally relented and sold his formula to General Mills. The mystery ingredient? Vegetable oil, which gave the cake richness and a light, moist texture. We spike this one with all the flavors of a Margarita cocktail; the Strawberry Compote with Tequila and Lime is an elegant touch.
5002995~Malted Vanilla Ice Cream with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces~2819~233~212~48~195~1678~672~"Chilling Time: 2 hours or overnight

One from the Soulshakers' greatest hits collection, this drink has been honed to a lethal edge over the past eight years at Gaz's Rocking Blues at London's Notting Hill Carnival and the Glastonbury Festival in southwest England."""
5002240~Simple Japanese White Rice~2413~558~0~45~0~0~0~Knowing that every Japanese cook would have strong opinions on the preparation of white rice, Ruggiero counted on her friend Ryuji Inoue, originally from Kyushu, Japan, for guidance. The result is fluffy and slightly stickier than Chinese rice. Even without a rice cooker, the rice comes out just perfect.
5002241~Cherry Almond Shortbread Cookies~3401~391~201~53~179~2496~257~Serve a platter of cookies alongside the pears and ice cream. The night before you make the cookies, place the dried cherries in a small bowl of crème de cassis. The soaking will infuse the fruit with the flavor of the black-currant liqueur.
5002242~Shrimp and Pork Pot Stickers~1146~224~22~101~25~2521~211~Crisp and golden, these juicy pot stickers, stuffed with a classic Cantonese filling, are more than just delicious — they're also a symbol of prosperity for the coming year.

5005032~Rugelach~2021~301~148~73~91~1820~135~"Sometime during the first year of my marriage, I visited my mother-in-law in her kitchen. There she was, listening to the radio, whistling (she is a formidable whistler) and rolling cream cheese dough around raisins and nuts to form the crescent-shaped cookies known as rugelach. I was spellbound—I'd had no idea that rugelach could be made at home. As far as I knew, rugelach, like ketchup or ships-in-bottles, were only made in laboratories. But here was my mother-in-law shaping the cookies with ease. And a short time later, there I was, eating them with ease. These cookies weren't like the rugelach my mother bought every week at the local German bakery—they were much better. I was so excited I asked for the recipe.
My mother-in-law wrote it out in her precise hand on a 3-x-5 index card. And, as she wrote, she told me that this recipe was not exactly the same as the one her mother used, that it had come from Mrs. Strauss, her next-door neighbor, and that she was sure I'd have no problem making the cookies as long as I didn't overmix the dough.
She was right. I was a newcomer to the world of baking, but I had no problem with the dough, the only potentially tricky part of the process.
Since then, I've made rugelach countless times, but nowadays my dough is even more foolproof because I make it in a food processor. I've also made a few other changes to the recipe. While my mother-in-law's rugelach were filled with cinnamon-sugared nuts, mine also include a slick of jam, some currants and a handful of chopped chocolate. This is a very old recipe, and I have no doubt that everyone who has made it has added or subtracted a little bit to make it her own—and my mom-in-law, Mrs. Strauss, and I expect you to do the same."
5002246~Mini Star-Anise Scones~3438~590~150~77~80~3431~242~Get the freshest ground star anise by making your own. It's as easy as grinding a few star anise pods in a spice mill or a coffee grinder.

5002251~Pizza 6: Pan-fried Hawaiian Pizza~212~25~14~20~3~2177~40~The pan-fried pizza move comes in handy during the summer when you don't want to turn the oven to 500°F.

5002260~Seared Tuna with Green Beans, Lemon and Wasabi~1206~108~18~31~56~2185~67~This dish isn't a makeover, per se. But there are so many beloved— and believe it or not, unhealthy—seared tuna dishes out there in the restaurant world that I thought I should offer at least one healthy version. The tuna is never the problem. Tuna is rich in nutrients, low in fat, delicious, and just a good bet all around. It's the stuff that's put on top that's the problem—anything from seared foie gras to deep-fried tempura crispies. Sure, it tastes great, but those additions turn a healthful dish into an artery-clogging one.

5002275~"Israeli Yogurt ""Cheese"" with Pita and Olives"~764~84~58~33~29~1593~37~"This tangy, fresh yogurt ""cheese"" -known as labaneh- vies for attention with hummus and tahini on the standard Israeli platter of mezze, or appetizers. Here it's seasoned with sesame seeds and spices, and drizzled with olive oil. Plan to start this the day before serving."
5002276~Pork Chops with Mustard Crust~211~0~0~0~23~190~63~Mustard lovers can serve the Mustard and Spring Onion Mash alongside.

5002278~Molten Chocolate Cakes with Cherries~1881~269~234~28~77~549~150~Try any leftover sauce on ice cream.
5002279~Cherry-Bourbon Pie~3174~479~293~57~122~2039~178~This crumble-topped pie stars the flavors of an Old Fashioned cocktail. Our secret weapon: jarred sour cherries (just think of all those cherries you won't have to pit!). We like Trader Joe's Dark Morello Cherries, but other brands work well, too.

5002281~Tortellini with Porcini Mushroom Sauce~1670~31~15~70~136~2898~397~Highly recommended!
5002282~Thyme–Walnut Sandies~5902~1035~814~72~227~2422~525~The texture of these delicate slice-and-bakes is similar to a Mexican wedding cookie: crumbly, but insanely tender.
5013464~Lemon Pudding with Strawberries and Meringue Cigars~3998~537~509~33~204~982~902~"This sublime lemon dessert is the perfect antidote to all those chocolate bunnies and chocolate-stuffed eggs proliferating at Easter like, well…rabbits. It helps that our pudding is simple to make, too.
A seriously tart lemon curd—quickly cooked on top of the stove—is folded into sweetened whipped cream, which both tempers the tang and lightens the dessert with a suave silkiness. Crisp, airy wisps of meringue, lightly sprinkled with chopped pistachios and easily shaped and baked into cigars, are delightful on their own, but they're surprisingly efficient alternatives to spoons for delivering the pudding to your mouth."

5002712~Chocolate Sorbet~2622~453~405~31~94~869~71~You would never guess that this dense and creamy dessert is nondairy and kosher for Passover. Since the recipe contains egg yolks, this is not a sorbet in the strict sense, but the yolks do provide a rich texture.
5010942~Grilled Scallions with Lemon~441~23~8~5~35~1519~10~If you want to make the scallions but not the rest of the menu (Grilled Pork Kebabs with Ginger Molasses Barbecue Sauce), see recipe for creamed grilled corn for instructions on preparing a charcoal grill.

5002301~Phyllo Triangles Stuffed with Fresh Cheese (briouats bil jben)~948~81~2~40~52~710~8~Hot, stuffed phyllo shapes called briouats are delectable appetizers. Folded into small triangles, cigar-shaped cylinders, or even rectangles, they come with an array of fillings, from spiced ground kefta to sweet milky rice. My favorite is this one with fresh unsalted cheese called jben—especially with a brushing of honey to give the crispy rolls a pleasing sweetness. Alternatively, dust the fried briouats with powdered sugar and cinnamon.
5002303~Rack of Lamb with Caramelized Shallot and Thyme Crust~747~121~29~11~20~315~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5003506~Grilled Yogurt-Marinated Leg of Lamb~1186~122~75~12~70~2142~61~Let the yogurt work its marinade magic overnight in this stunning main course. Look for a small butterflied boneless leg of lamb at your supermarket, or ask your butcher to butterfly one for you.
5002321~Braised Veal Shanks with Bacon-Parmesan Crumbs~3067~313~28~92~134~8984~193~There's marrow in those bones! Scoop out the cooked marrow and whisk it into the braising liquid, or eat it on a crust of bread with salt. You earned it.
5011185~Toasted Pumpkin Seeds~39~0~0~0~4~0~0~Don't think of toasted pumpkin seeds merely as a topping for the Risotto with Tuscan Kale — they also make a terrific hors d'oeuvre or snack.<
5002323~Miso Soup with Vegetables and Tofu~807~87~22~30~22~2065~10~Tofu is a surprisingly rich source of calcium, which may discourage your body from storing fat, especially in the tummy region. Break out the bikini!

5002334~Twice-Baked Butternut Squash With Parmesan Cream and Candied Bacon~3486~89~61~110~312~5857~1099~This impressive side dish is a play on the classic twice-baked potato with amped-up toppings of Parmesan whipped cream, candied hazelnut-bacon bits, and fresh chives.
5002335~Sicilian Tuna~1348~84~38~36~72~881~87~Even those who prefer their tuna raw or quickly seared will be won over by this preparation.

5002343~Rabbit Cacciatore~1154~116~71~8~69~115~0~To most Americans, Ischia, off the coast of Naples, is relatively unknown. That's a shame, because for centuries this island's thermal springs have been luring savvy travelers for restorative dips; plus, the locals produce some of the best wine in the region. At La Pergola, a family-run inn located on a hill just outside of Forio, guests enjoy some of that homemade wine, along with artisanal jams and olive oil. La Pergola also serves one of the island's most popular dishes, rabbit cacciatore, or hunter's rabbit.
5002344~Butter Mandu (Butter Dumplings)~5909~84~30~181~565~11353~1539~This recipe comes from New York chef Deuki Hong's father and has origins in North Korea, the ancestral home of mandu. (Sharing a border with China, it is no coincidence that mandu sounds a lot like the Chinese word for steamed bread, mantou.) Unlike versions stuffed with finely chopped kimchi, Deuki grew up eating mandu with kimchi on the side. The star in this recipe is the very generous quantity of butter, which is mixed in with the pork, garlic and ginger and adds a real-deal richness to each bite. Not typically used in East Asian cooking, butter is a fully Americanized, fully awesome way to rethink the mandu.
5002345~Iced Ginger Tea with Lemon and Cloves~1046~250~249~0~0~7~0~This is a traditional homemade drink that's found all across West Africa. It's sometimes called ginger beer, though it's not alcoholic.

Wrapped up in crispy lettuce, these cups can be eaten like tacos.
5002350~Dashi Stracciatella~876~74~0~70~38~3687~441~Sometimes all your body wants is a vacation from intense eating. That's where this feel-good (but fill-you-up) broth comes in.

5018484~Roast Turkey with Cider Sage Gravy~1842~176~72~19~116~6846~308~Everyone wants the juiciest turkey possible for Thanksgiving, and we find that brined or kosher turkeys are best for this. If you'd like to try brining, stir together 8 quarts water with 2 cups kosher salt in a 5-gallon bucket lined with a large heavy-duty plastic garbage bag, then soak raw turkey, covered and chilled, 10 hours. (Kosher turkeys, which are salted during the koshering process, are just as succulent and flavorful as brined ones.) If you are making this entire menu in a single oven, bake the stuffing and sweet potatoes and reheat the potato parsnip purée while the turkey stands after roasting.
5002356~Hot Cauliflower with Shrimp~1751~99~58~147~93~6348~1371~Norwegian men have taken to cooking for fun, and this excellent luncheon entrée is from Derek Blixen, manager of the Pan American World Airways Oslo office.

5016659~Cream Cheese-Lemon Zest Frosting~3376~652~630~0~79~40~214~This is a great frosting for the Carrot Cake . The lemon zest complements the cream cheese so perfectly that I sometimes even snack on this frosting—I just can't get enough of the sweet, tangy flavor! If you want extra oomph on the Carrot Cake, add minced ginger to the lemon zest.
5002359~White Sweet Potatoes with Mirin and Honey~744~99~79~1~32~1713~63~Transform sweet potatoes into caramelized beauties by cooking them with rice wine and honey. Serve them alongside roast duck or pork chops.
5002360~Poached Salmon with Artichoke Confit~8191~204~86~11~829~5959~0~Both the salmon and the artichokes are poached in spice-and herb-infused liquids, adding layers of subtle aromatic flavor.
5002361~Pork Chops with Golden Onions and Wilted Tomatoes~802~61~30~22~50~4586~45~Highly recommended!
5007250~Cherry-Almond Crisp~6596~926~774~36~278~11~127~Brown sugar, almonds and oats combine for a crunchy topping in this lovely dessert. A touch of kirsch, a clear cherry brandy, enhances the fruit.
5002363~Black Pudding~5984~311~141~37~498~7695~534~"People—not just the Irish—have been eating blood puddings for centuries, in cultures all around the world. No Irish fry is truly complete without at least a slice of black and a slice of white pudding. And it's not just for breakfast anymore. Talented Irish chefs have found ways to incorporate it into salads and main dishes. Black pudding recipe vary wildly throughout Ireland; some include barley, breadcrumbs, and flour, but oatmeal is the old-fashioned thickener. Be sure it's steel-cut or pinhead oatmeal, and cook it until just tender. Individual nubs of oats should be visible in the final product. Store-bought versions will always be made in sausage casings, unlike this recipe, packed into a loaf pan.
It is far easier to buy black pudding ready-made, and there are lots of artisan producers making truly worthy black versions. But if you're able to come into possession of fresh pig's blood, you'll be all set to make this recipe. And if not—well, you'll know precisely what a good black pudding should contain."
5002364~Grilled Cheese With Peak Tomatoes~2634~375~22~72~107~4871~63~Progression of a tomato sandwich: On buttered bread with salt; on bread with mayo and cheddar; seasoned and grilled with cheddar and mayo. They’re all pretty perfect, but we’ll take the advanced version, thanks.

The cake has a coarse crumb yet is incredibly moist and chewy, thanks to the dates. A sprinkle of our Passover version of powdered sugar dresses up the torte for a special occasion.
5002368~Coconut Shrimp with Sweet Chili-Lime Sauce~1072~215~74~38~1~2582~194~Highly recommended!

This pretty and delicious drink is a new take on the classic Kir Royale, a mixture of Champagne and black-currant liqueur. Here, Prosecco (the Italian bubbly) stands in for the Champagne, and peach nectar and liqueur are used instead of crème de cassis.
5002389~Lamb and Dried-Tomato Strudel~3849~202~125~132~281~7423~430~Highly recommended!
5018517~Yogurt and Lemon Dressing~76~13~10~4~0~79~4~I think we all play favorites in the kitchen; I know I do. One day I am all over my Tahini-Lemon-Yogurt Dressing, dreaming up salads and dishes that would marry well with its salty tang. Then, suddenly, I abandon it in favor of another dressing and another direction. At this writing, this is my most loved dressing, and I drizzle it on everything I can get my hands on!
5002391~Salsa Del Sol~362~22~18~3~27~462~3~This salsa is chock-full of sun-loving ingredients like tomatoes, olives and capers. It's a splendid accompaniment to grilled halibut steaks, pork chops, sliced eggplant or sourdough bread.
5002392~Skirt Steak with Peppers, Raisins, and Almonds~2131~112~47~153~112~6784~381~In this dish, inspired by Cuban cooking, hints of clove and cinnamon whisk a standby cowboy steak to the Caribbean.
5002393~Roast Beef with Rosemary Mayonnaise~4237~219~70~54~359~5972~569~Serve the roast beef and the mayonnaise on their own, or put assorted breads alongside so that guests can make little sandwiches.
5006862~Toasted Orzo with Saffron and Fennel~271~7~3~0~27~0~0~Because of its shape, orzo can do nearly anything rice can do, and if youre a pasta lover, you might say orzo does it better. Saffron and fennel are two characteristic flavors in many Mediterranean dishes.
5002395~Roasted Spiced Chicken with Cinnamon- and Honey-Glazed Sweet Potatoes~1187~126~77~22~60~4406~167~This dish makes delicious use of the warm spices prevalent throughout island cooking. The chicken needs time to marinate, so start the recipe ahead.

5004744~Sour Cherry Sauce~147~33~29~0~0~187~0~Highly recommended!
5002399~Glazed Cooked and Raw Asparagus with Butter and Parmesan~1254~4~0~38~120~6576~272~This is a rich yet exquisitely simple dish that can be at its best only if every ingredient is of top quality. The asparagus must be fresh and in season, brightly colored, and crisp, with almost a glow in the center of the stalk. If you can buy butter from Normandy, use it; for Parmesan, use only Parmigiano-Reggiano, with its full, ripe flavor. The asparagus is not actually rôtie, or roasted, but rather sautéed in butter until it has a gilded, roasted appearance. The sprinkling of chopped raw asparagus at the end adds crunch and a slightly nutty taste to a dish of silken textures and flavors.
5002400~Strawberry Baked Alaska~5748~907~795~82~228~741~1045~This dessert can be made one day ahead and stored in the freezer, making it ideal for entertaining. You can create the decorative meringue swirls and peaks with a rubber spatula, table knife, or spoon, but an offset spatula works best.
5005081~Fennel and Sausage Ragù Over Pasta~253~11~5~0~16~1637~0~This ragù would also be excellent served over instant polenta instead of pasta.
5002402~Steak with Anchovy Garlic Butter~1269~34~0~2~120~1792~224~The garlicky spread that tops this steak is also excellent on fish, chicken, and pasta. Make extra and freeze it for a super finish for future weeknight dinners.
5004426~Porcini-Rubbed Turkey with Shiitake-Madeira Gravy~2120~126~20~45~152~8110~364~With its use of dried porcini in the turkey rub and fresh shiitakes in the light gravy, this recipe from the late food writer Michael McLaughlin is a fine example of his signature style: deeply flavorful seasonal cooking. You can make the turkey stock for the gravy up to two days ahead.
5002404~Broiled Lamb Chops with Lemon Caper Sauce~127~1~1~0~12~76~31~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5002410~Roast Chicken with Crisp Toasts and Ricotta~2403~84~11~49~214~6605~345~Does Bloomfield's roast chicken recipe take work? Yes, but the results—from the drippings-soaked sourdough toasts to the glossy pan sauce—are transcendent.

5002460~Apple Crostata with Spiced Caramel Sauce~4349~519~302~96~274~797~809~Do you love apple pie, but feel stuck in a classic-pie rut at Thanksgiving? Bake outside the box this year with the Italian version, known as crostata. Unlike typical American pie pastry, crostata pastry is similar to cookie dough, so instead of being flaky, it bakes up like a crisp, chewy sugar cookie. Drizzle slices with warm spiced caramel sauce, and you just might count yourself among the crostata converts.
5002414~Grilled Lobster with Ginger, Garlic, and Soy Sauce~3553~132~53~23~331~7110~0~For food safety, it is very important to grill the lobsters immediately after they have been boiled and split.

5002417~Dairy State Buttered Burgers~1365~50~8~78~92~682~322~Many cooks of Wisconsin and Minnesota consider it patriotic to add extra butter to a dish whenever possible. At drive-ins in these two states, butter is not considered merely a hamburger condiment but an integral component. After studying a slew of burger flippers at work in Milwaukee, we devised the following recipe:

5002424~Monte Cubano~1360~108~13~73~62~3008~252~This two-in-one indulgence has the irresistible makings of a Cuban sandwich, including Swiss cheese, pickles, and sliced meats—but its also dipped in egg batter and fried like a Monte Cristo.
5002425~Thai-Curry Seafood Stew~1037~31~8~159~25~5624~723~Round out this menu with a salad of snow peas, cherry tomatoes, and bean sprouts dressed with a rice-wine vinaigrette. For dessert, sliced kiwis splashed with rum would be good. Look for the curry paste, coconut milk, fish sauce, and jasmine rice in the Asian foods section of your supermarket.
5002426~Corned Beef and Cabbage~2644~400~190~139~56~7400~158~Highly recommended!
5006762~Roast Turkey with Black-Truffle Butter and White-Wine Gravy~2056~66~10~41~152~6056~317~"When food editor Shelley Wiseman was asked to develop a recipe for an over-the-top turkey, she began by rubbing truffle butter under its skin. ""Its a cheap shot,"" she admitted, ""but its damn delicious."" We all agreed—its the best turkey most of us have ever tasted. The butter, an excellent carrier of that unmistakable truffle flavor, moistens the turkeys meat and crisps its skin during a high-heat roast. For this splendid centerpiece, a nuanced French shallot-wine sauce is just the thing."
5002428~Coconut Crème Brûlée~1459~2~0~9~167~1348~695~Highly recommended!
5002429~Green Curry Pork Tenderloin~2796~157~86~101~195~8050~58~Start this recipe one day ahead; the pork is best if it is left to marinate overnight.

In this recipe, white cheddar goes into a rich and creamy potato gratin that is a great substitute for — or, at a particularly lavish feast, a fine accompaniment to — mashed potatoes.
5002434~Tex-Mex Flank Steak Salad~4201~595~80~234~140~8731~331~Highly recommended!
5002435~Veal Birds Paprika~2451~246~46~31~151~4224~284~"As Gourmet wrote in 1959: ""Long ago...it did occur to some blithe spirit, a poet of the kitchen to be sure, that when these little veal rolls were arranged on a platter they looked like a flock of headless birds. And oiseaux sans têtes, or veal birds, they remain to this day in the cuisines of such diverse countries as Belgium, Italy, and France."
5002436~Roasted Beet Salad with Oranges and Beet Greens~787~63~19~0~58~1100~0~The delicate beet greens — which are an excellent source of potassium, folic acid, and magnesium — make this dish even more healthful.
5002437~Lemon-Scented Saffron Rice~1611~297~11~22~34~22~94~This creamy rice, fragrant with lemon, makes a nice accompaniment to veal. If you like, pack the rice into half-cup custard cups and unmold onto the serving plates. Garnish with additional snipped chives, if desired.

5002441~Apple Cider Doughnuts with Cider-Caramel Glaze~22931~1496~1122~96~2007~5015~320~"The classic farmstand treat gets a double dose of cider goodness from a reduced cider ""syrup"" that is both mixed into the dough and used as the base for the shiny glaze."
5002442~Slow-Roasted Red-Wine-Lacquered Salmon Fillet~2160~72~59~161~131~18867~421~Slow-roasting at a very low temperature results in extremely tender salmon. The richness of the fish is accented by a salty-sweet red-wine sauce, which thickens into a syrupy glaze during cooking.
5002443~Chocolate Kumquat Spring Rolls~1289~140~107~33~72~852~85~"Spring rolls are the quintessential Asian appetizer, but I have adapted the concept to dessert. When cooked, these rolls are like cylindrical molten cakes with warm chocolate oozing out of an impossibly thin and crisp ""pastry"" shell. The kumquats not only cut through the richness with their distinct citrus tartness, but also are a symbol of good fortune, as kum is a homonym for ""gold"" in Chinese."
5002444~Beer-Battered Fish with Smoked-Paprika Mayonnaise~1057~99~15~33~84~2713~126~This recipe brings smoky paprika and a jolt of briny capers to fish and chips.

5009632~Fresh Fennel Pan Gravy~427~70~4~10~1~2622~0~"The technique: Pan juices—the flavorful liquid and crispy bits left in the roasting pan— form the base of this gravy. To prevent lumps, thoroughly whisk in the flour, then gradually add the wine and stock, whisking until smooth.
The pay off: Super-roasty flavor."

5002454~Steak Diane~473~22~5~5~40~884~73~Requiring labor-intensive veal stock and a tableside flambé, this tony restaurant dish is usually impractical for the home cook. But we've found a shortcut you'll love: Using just a bit of puréed black-bean soup creates a wonderfully velvety—and completely convincing—sauce.
5002455~Sefrou Apricot (Galettes Sucrees)~5083~698~302~191~275~2639~370~"Call them galettes sucrees, mandelbrot, or biscotti — I love these Moroccan cookies, made by Rosette Toledano of Netanya, who, as her daughter says, ""puts her heart in her cooking."""
5002456~Highland Cooler~249~93~7~0~0~1~0~Highly recommended!

5016731~Potato-Leek Matzo Balls~4902~1016~142~120~22~22419~370~A leek puree adds rich flavor. This side dish is especially good with the Brisket with Dried Apricots, Prunes, and Aromatic Spices recipe.
5002462~Cranberry, Pomegranate, and Meyer Lemon Relish~3750~926~777~0~0~16~0~A refreshingly tart version of classic cranberry sauce. If you want it sweeter, just add more sugar.
5002463~Roast Goose with Caramelized Apples~660~159~111~0~0~4~0~Roast goose with apples, a specialty of Alsace, has become a classic Hanukkah dish in Paris. This recipe comes from Didier Lewkowicz, a butcher in the old Jewish quarter of Paris. Serve a French red Bordeaux with the goose.

5014497~Gloria's Black Bean Soup~3069~172~54~33~253~12911~0~This is one of my mother's recipes and call me biased, but it's the best around. This is a vegetarian black bean soup, and one of the keys to its success is the quality of the olive oil: use the very best you can find. You can make the soup a day in advance and it will taste even better the next day. This is a no-fail recipe that I know you're going to enjoy.
5002480~Melon and Mint Tabbouleh~1935~462~211~21~6~2050~0~Removing the typical cucumber from tabbouleh leaves plenty of room for fresh honeydew or any cool, sweet melon in this summer-inspired departure.
5009020~Crispy Garlic Chips~2059~33~0~0~220~0~0~"The French have a saying, ""You must watch what you're cooking like milk on the stove,"" referring, of course, to the fact that milk can boil over in a flash. Case in point: Garlic chips are sweet and nutty when cooked just right, but let them go just a little too long, and they become burnt and acrid."

5002487~Green-Grape Sangria~1316~325~291~3~1~633~0~Surely you've had one too many supersweet sangrias whose fruit chunks overpower the (usually mediocre) wine. This version couldn't be more of a contrast, with a refreshing mintiness and subtly aromatic fruit that still allow the crispness of the white wine to come through.
5002488~Stout Spice Cake with Lemon Glaze~6750~1084~680~203~312~5813~605~Stout, in the sharper-flavored ale family of brews popular in Great Britain, gains its dark color from the roasted malt used in its brewing. The rich, malty flavor melds well with the molasses and aromatics in this moist cake, which is brightened with a lemon glaze.
5002489~Chicken Pot Tot Hotdish~3528~272~101~149~225~5156~744~"The battle of Most Iconic Hotdish would probably come down to Tater Tot versus wild rice, which is kind of like arguing over which Matthew McConaughey role is the most definitive, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days? Or Dallas Buyers Club? Tater Tot hotdish is typically ground beef, creamed soup (often mushroom), some sort of vegetable (probably peas or green beans, maybe some corn), and then, in the words of Sam Sifton, ""You cover the bitch with Tater Tots."" But you don’t just throw them on like an abstract topping, you have to let your OCD hang out a little and organize them in rows and columns, as neatly as possible. This organizing of the tots might be one of the most sacred food rituals in the Midwest, second only to making lefse. My Tater Tot hotdish has the body of a chicken pot pie, a dish that I loved growing up, long before I knew the existence of Tater Tot hotdish. But a close examination reveals that the only real differences are the subbing of chicken for ground beef and the use of a homemade cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom soup. I don’t think this will offend a hotdish purist."

The ice cream is as blissful to prepare as it is to eat: Just purée everything in a blender, then freeze in an ice cream maker.
5002496~Sun-dried Tomato and Fennel Sausage Patties with Creamy Polenta~3337~116~34~219~184~17253~788~Fennel pollen, a relatively new spice here in America, is very popular in Italy. It is more subtle and delicate than fennel seeds, and it marries particularly well with pork. If you can't find fennel pollen, substitute freshly ground fennel seeds.

5008174~Citrus Vinaigrette~1565~31~22~0~165~36~0~Always make more salad dressing than you'll need. It takes no longer to mix a big batch, and it means tomorrow night's salad will be ready in minutes. This recipe makes enough vinaigrette for three large salads.
5002502~Salami and Pickle Grilled Cheese~1533~53~0~55~117~3723~368~This sandwich can be lunch, a snack, or a late-night thing. Eat it with potato chips and lemonade; it's also great with a simple green salad for dinner.

5002509~Fried Egg Sandwiches with Pancetta and Arugula~464~2~1~34~35~1045~423~Don't add salt to the fried eggs or arugula—the pancetta and cheese are salty and add plenty of flavor.
5002510~Maple-Braised Butternut Squash with Fresh Thyme~644~1~1~1~69~3445~189~"The technique: Braising (sautéing, then cooking low and slow in a bit of liquid) is most often associated with meat, but it's also a great way to cook veggies.
The payoff: Fibrous vegetables like butternut squash are the perfect candidates for braising. The braising liquid infuses the squash with flavor and makes it very tender."

5002515~Roasted Citrus and Avocado Salad~1546~227~177~4~73~1672~0~Baking citrus at a high heat caramelizes the sugars and adds depth. It's just the thing to bring intrigue to salads and more.
5002516~Panna Cotta with Lemon-Thyme Peaches~1451~104~94~14~118~6182~402~Though we can appreciate the beauty of a panna cotta that's been turned out of its mold, the light-as-air texture of these, just set enough to melt in the mouth, will have you happy to eat them right from the cup. Yogurt gives the almond-infused cream a little tang, and peaches that have been macerated with lemon thyme just long enough to meld and soften seem to exist expressly for this dessert.
5002517~Grilled Lemongrass Lamb Chops with Herbs~900~152~89~21~16~2742~81~Aromatic without being spicy, this dish has a touch of the exotic but will please traditionalists, too. The spice paste hits on sweet, hot, salty, and sour, and the lamb is wonderfully tender.

5002520~Cranberry Horseradish Sauce~100~20~0~0~0~600~0~Cranberries mixed with sugar and citrus are perfectly fine for turkey, but pork needs something a little different. Here, the tart quality of the cranberries is underlined by the horseradish, and together they enhance the sweet, sturdy nature of roast pork.
5002521~Pork and Squash Stew with Chiles~5951~127~74~440~384~28572~1457~This stew calls for water instead of stock to be added. The pork shoulder will create a rich cooking liquid on its own.

5002523~Japanese Cucumber Salad with Vinegar~229~14~14~30~0~6722~29~Highly recommended!
5002524~Asparagus, Fingerling Potato, and Goat Cheese Pizza~1688~152~28~85~88~5484~197~It's the possibilities in that blank crust that make pizza so much fun. Lately, we've been obsessed with white pizza. Brush the dough with olive oil, sprinkle with mozzarella, and then let the fun begin. Without the acidity of the tomato sauce to contend with, you can really experiment. In this version, asparagus adds freshness and a hit of color, goat cheese brings a creamy tang, and fingerling potatoes (yes, potatoes) round out the pie with their richness.
5002525~Baked Polenta with Fontina Cheese~4673~481~6~181~209~2455~806~Polenta is layered with Fontina cheese and cream in this decadent casserole. Offer it with the sausages and tomato sauce, or on its own as a brunch or lunch dish.

5002539~Mixed Mushrooms Stroganoff~851~39~6~11~70~2127~0~If you have mushroom fans in your family, this contemporary take on a classic pasta dish is bound to please. High-calorie sour cream is replaced with a healthy dose of soy.

5002545~Flatbread with Fava Beans, Cucumbers, and Burrata~2057~275~13~118~52~1376~0~Fava beans most likely require a trip to a farmers’ market and take a while to peel. Sugar snap peas cut into bite-size pieces are a fine alternative.

5002548~Grilled Pork Tenderloin with Fresh Peach and Ginger Sauce~2401~158~132~137~130~16771~369~The robust sauce doubles as a marinade for this easy and elegant entrée. Begin preparing well before serving so that the pork has time to marinate. Accompany with boiled green beans and a full-bodied Zinfandel.

5002562~Ginger-Hoisin Beef and Scallions on Crispy Noodle Cakes~1674~130~31~20~123~3081~10~To form the noodle cakes, measure them out by taking a few strands of noodles and loosely squiggling them into a tablespoon. Once you get the hang of the amount needed, you can pretty much eyeball it.

Be sure the potatoes are still warm when you add them to the dressing; they’ll absorb it better, enhancing the flavor of the dish.
5002565~Hot Chocolate with Raspberries~2791~156~132~18~251~728~721~Highly recommended!
5002566~Fresh Pineapple Trifles with Orange-Coconut Cream~755~180~144~3~0~43~0~Even easier: Buy fresh pineapple that's already been peeled.
5002567~Simple Smoked Beef Short Ribs~88~20~9~22~10~14165~71~This simple recipe did not take the blue ribbon at any barbecue contest. It did come in third—by 2 points…in the Anything Butt Brisket category. In that category, you could barbecue anything but brisket and sirloin. Chef Paul chose to do beef short ribs, and almost everybody said he didn't have a chance of winning or even placing because he was going up against beef tenderloin, rib-eyes, T-bones, and porterhouse steaks. What did they know?!
5008786~Potato Silk with Truffle Oil~1826~317~83~36~39~9136~91~Extra milk makes these potatoes silky-smooth, and truffle oil adds luxurious flavor.
5002570~Duck-Fat Turkey Breasts with Green Onion Puree~1142~53~13~23~85~670~189~Chef Sean Brock created this dish using quail, but the technique pairs equally well with bone-in turkey breast, creating a surprisingly juicy version of a much-maligned cut. Searing a turkey breast on the stovetop crisps the skin beautifully, while basting with thyme- and garlic-scented duck fat enriches the lean meat. Green onions stand in for the green garlic for a silky, fresh sauce that's a welcome departure from classic gravy. Be sure to use homemade vegetable stock or a clear canned stock to preserve the brilliant green color. You can find duck fat from many gourmet shops, or online from D'Artagnan.
5002571~Couscous with Zucchini and Cherry Tomatoes~3699~558~184~89~116~45045~314~An easy side dish that goes great with Peppered Beef slices with Green Onions and Radishes .
5002572~Creamed Chicken with Corn and Bacon Over Polenta~4642~389~58~157~266~11584~884~If you have leftover roast chicken or turkey, use it here and save a step. You'll need 3 cups of shredded meat.
5002573~Mushroom Soup with Hazelnut Gremolata~1511~155~48~29~82~7031~166~Gremolata is traditionally made with chopped garlic, parsley, and lemon peel; this one incorporates chopped hazelnuts and uses orange peel instead of lemon.

5009540~Shoe String Potatoes (Pommes Pailles)~12239~17~0~2~1419~0~0~A mountain of skinny, crisp fries adds drama to the plate. Unlike thick-cut fries, which are traditionally fried twice (first to cook them through and then to crisp them), shoestrings are fried only once. And like potato chips, they taste great at any temperature.

5002588~Skillet Corn Bread~2120~287~0~37~88~2094~584~Chef Susan Goss says that the secret here is in her cast-iron skillet. Nonstick pans produce anemic, soft corn bread. This recipe also works well with corn-stick or muffin molds, as long as they’re well-seasoned cast iron. If your pan is hot enough, the batter will immediately rise and start to cook around the edges. (The restaurant’s skillets rarely leave the oven.)
5002589~Grilled Shrimp Salad with Lemongrass and Chiles~721~159~96~7~3~8524~10~For a milder dish, use fewer Thai chiles and seed the serranos before mincing them.
5002590~Lemon Buttermilk Pie~4445~382~276~110~211~1170~799~Lemon brightens the sweet tang of buttermilk in this dairy-state specialty.
5014322~Turkey Broth~6175~20~13~934~243~5418~3632~This yields enough broth for the gravy and the stuffing . Use heavy large rimmed baking sheets; regular ones may buckle.
5019998~Highland Fling~168~31~23~1~4~0~0~Highly recommended!
5014663~Spice-Rubbed Turkey with Cognac Gravy~640~111~111~21~3~22134~3~Be sure to rub the turkey with the spice mixture the day before roasting.
5002595~Baby Potatoes with Parsley and Lemon Butter~5434~1009~202~100~94~33741~189~Highly recommended!

5002598~Holiday Apple-Raisin Challah~4091~740~109~297~176~3269~374~The trick to making great challah is to add just enough eggs and oil to the dough so that it tastes rich and moist without becoming heavy and sticky. My friend Kathy Cohen gets it exactly right—her bread, stuffed with apples, raisins, and cinnamon, is the highlight of her annual Jewish New Year feast. For years, I'd count the days between slices, until I finally decided to ask for the recipe.
5002599~Chicken Pasta Salad in Creamy Curry Dressing~961~123~12~28~37~41477~164~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5002600~Roasted-Vegetable Lasagne~2834~277~115~87~148~6503~306~Roasted vegetables and Italian Fontina lend this lush-tasting lasagne a more intense flavor than than you'd get with the usual spinach and ricotta filling.
5002601~Pecan-Crusted Trout with Orange-Rosemary Butter Sauce~6838~602~344~81~463~3788~524~At the fish market, ask them to remove the head, tail and bones from the trout, then to cut each trout into two fillets, leaving the skin intact.
5002602~Braised Spiced Pork with Cao Lau Noodles~5605~654~88~231~224~18722~730~The synthesis of fresh and longcooked textures; rich, sweet, and herbal flavors; and juicy and crunchy garnishes. Serve with extra herbs, chiles, and lime so everyone can customize his own bowl.
5002603~Herbed Tuna Burgers with Tapenade and Tomatoes~2680~142~33~258~122~6310~363~The combination of tuna and olives is reminiscent of a salade niçoise.
5002604~Easy Arancini~737~107~0~58~18~1580~398~You might like to double up the ingredients here, because this is effectively two meals in one. You start by making a wonderful, rich mushroom risotto, which you could serve warm one night (perhaps finished with a drizzle of olive oil), and then you could make these rice balls for the following evening. They are perfect with a glass of prosecco (or champagne if you haven't really gotten the hang of this economizing business).
5014699~Negroni~531~209~4~0~0~0~0~"This version of the classic, bitter Italian cocktail was created by Eben Freeman, bartender of Tailor restaurant in New York City. The video also demonstrates the ""flaming zest"" orange twist technique, which heats the oils, making for a very aromatic drink."

5002621~Frozen Coconut Yogurt with Cinnamon~607~32~28~65~24~284~120~Frozen yogurt! I mean let's face it: Everybody loves a good frozen yogurt. Adults, tweens, teens, kids, whoever. You've seen it a hundred times at your local ice cream parlor on Sunday in the summer: 9:00 p.m. and the place is packed! A line around the corner, kids playing, everybody's happy; it's the sweet life. For a diabetic, that could go two ways: One way is horribly wrong, and that's if there're no sugar-free items on the board. Or, totally great because they do offer some special items for people with some sort of dietary restriction. Or there's Plan C, which is that you make a batch of this silky, creamy, coconut yogurt at home and relax with the fam on Sunday night. Let the others rush to the corner store and wait in line; your only fear will be whether or not your family leaves you any.

At first glance, Sicilian cooking seems very simple, but that simplicity depends on using the freshest ingredients and often the combination of sweet and tart flavors. The anchovy pasta and the ricotta and mascarpone cream puffs here are perfect examples."""

That is, unless you're one of those people who need to start off the day with eggs or bacon or anything not sweet. For those customers, we've created the ultimate quick grab-'n'-go breakfast using items we already have in-house: brioche dough, cheese, breakfast meats, and eggs. The dough, after an overnight rest in the refrigerator during which it develops flavor, is stretched and pulled like you would a pizza dough to make a flat round."

No family or social event is complete without the firing up of a grill (often half of a 55-gallon drum). Given Guam's proximity to the Philippines and Japan, it comes as no surprise that soy sauce, ginger, and wasabi should figure prominently in the local grilling. Here's the Pacific Island version of a grilled blackened tuna from my Guamanian barbecue buddy, Steven Cruz. The tuna is crusted with Old Bay seasoning. (OK, it's a long way from Baltimore to Guam, but apparently this Maryland seafood seasoning enjoys great popularity on the island.) Ginger, wasabi, and chiles give the dipping sauce a triple blast of heat.

5002693~Maple-Glazed Tuna with Pear-Potato Salad~785~83~77~0~55~357~0~"I met twelve-year-old Frank Liranzo when I was teaching a kids' cooking class at the YMCA's environmental camp in Huguenot, New York. The kids learned how to tap trees to make maple syrup, a process I'd read about but never seen in action. Frank was one of the campers, and he got to experience firsthand the old art of making maple syrup. ""You put tubes into the trees so the sap flows out,"" he says. ""When it first comes out of the tree, it tastes like sugary water. Then we went to the sugar shack where we saw the sap boiled down until it tasted like syrup."" At the camp, I made this Maple-Glazed Tuna with Pear-Potato Salad for the kids. ""I thought it would taste really sugary, but it didn't,"" Frank told me. ""First I tasted the fish, then a hint of mustard, and then an aftertaste of the maple syrup."" I love how the syrup adds sweetness and a beautiful caramelized crust to the meaty tuna steaks, while the sweetness of the pears in the accompanying potato salad balances nicely with the glazed tuna."
5002694~Champagne Americana~573~72~65~33~19~992~105~This Franco-American combination of bourbon and bubbles gives you another reason to be thankful. It doubles easily to accommodate the number of guests around your holiday table.
5002695~Honey-Glazed Doughnuts with Raisins and Pine Nuts~4800~942~345~127~60~1164~4~For the Mediterranean's Sephardic Jews, sweet fried pastries are as strong a tradition as potato latkes are for Eastern Europe's Ashkenazic Jews. The version here is distinctive for the addition of raisins and pine nuts, inspired by a Roman recipe.
5002696~My Mother's Butter, Tomato, and Onion Sauce~708~36~28~7~58~3043~158~"If I had to pick one dish that exemplifies ""Hazan family favorites,"" it would be this sauce. It is ridiculously simple. You put four ingredients into a pot and place it on the stove. The onion is just peeled and cut in half, no chopping or slicing required. And if you are using canned tomatoes, all you do is open the can, pour it in the pot, and break up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon. But it's not because of how easy it is that it's a favorite; it's because the flavor is addictively delicious. At our cooking school in Italy we offer a ""level-two"" course for those who want to return for more. I always ask what dish from the first course is their favorite. Out of a week of classes and restaurant meals, the majority say it is this sauce that they remember best. As an added bonus, it can be frozen and will taste just as good when thawed and reheated months later. If you do make a larger batch, be aware that the cooking time will increase."

5002721~Braised Duck with Turnips~920~120~55~12~15~5147~0~For centuries, the French have been braising duck as a way to tenderize it, whether the duck was wild or tame (use only farm-raised duck in the recipe below). The slight bitterness of turnips nicely offsets the flavorful meat rich but simple sauce.

If you're a chile head, you'll probably want to up the number of chiles and leave the seeds in. If your friends are more, ahem, delicate, then stick with one chile and remove the seeds and ribs.

5014409~How To Temper Chocolate~3180~408~317~45~181~1362~136~Tempered chocolate has a shiny, flawless appearance. It feels firm and breaks off with a snap when you bite into it and it melts smoothly in your mouth, allowing you to fully enjoy the flavor. Slowly heating and cooling melted chocolate while stirring puts it into temper. If chocolate is not tempered properly, the cocoa butter crystallization is uncontrolled and uneven, which results in an unattractive chocolate that is dull or has white streaks running through it. Untempered chocolate may feel rough or tacky and have a cakey, almost chewy texture. And it is more susceptible to heat and humidity, melting more easily and spoiling more quickly. Some simple candy recipes do not require tempered chocolate. However, candies such as truffles, dipped chocolates, and chocolate bars require tempering to achieve their signature appearance, taste, and texture.

5002772~Toum (Garlic Sauce)~4056~39~3~0~416~6186~0~If there were ever a love song to garlic, Lebanese toum (pronounced TOOM) is the finest aria of them all. Toum, which means “garlic” in Arabic, is pure garlic flavor that is brightened with lemon; you’ll find yourself stirring toum into just about any recipe that calls for minced garlic, as well as its classic Lebanese pairing with grilled meats such as Yogurt Marinated Chicken Skewers. A spoonful of toum elevates any steamed or roasted vegetable, or pasta or grains—or as a dipping sauce for good bread. I’ve even taken to slathering it on my homemade white pizzas before baking. Making toum requires a slow and steady hand to emulsify the garlic and oil in the food processor; consider toum like an aïoli with no egg. There are many methods cooks use to avoid a broken toum emulsion, such as adding an egg white, cooked potato, or cornstarch to the mix. I like my toum made without any of those, which can be replaced with patience—and a little ice water, which helps the emulsion hold.

We all tossed a bunch of ideas out there, and one of them was french toast bread pudding. All heads tilted curiously at this idea, so of course we tried it. The idea was for it to be like a true bread pudding—tea-infused, of course—but when the first batch came out, our chef said, ""I don't think this one is right—the top is crisp and chewy, but the bottom may be mushy."" We tried it, and lo and behold, there it was, the brunch item that would make eyes widen and taste buds explode: a layer of crisp and chewy french toast on top and a wonderfully gooey, creamy bread pudding infused with apricot brandy tea underneath. Note that you will need eight 2-inch-deep oven-safe glass bowls (8-ounce ramekins or crème brûlée dishes work well)."

5002889~Cool Jade Soup~1291~61~31~10~114~2469~10~The inspiration for test kitchen director Ruth Cousineaus velvety chilled bean soup comes from Mediterranean-cooking authority Claudia Roden's recipe for bissara, an Egyptian bean-and-herb purée. The beans here are lima and green, simmered in chicken broth (you can use vegetable broth if you want to go vegetarian) and then puréed until silky. The herbs—parsley, cilantro, dill, and mint—are blended with olive oil so that you can finish the soup with a verdant drizzle, but dont think of the herb oil as merely a garnish: Its bright flavor brings everything together.

Because you hack the fish into bits, there's no need to find perfect-for-presentation fillets, so this is a great way to use those that aren't flawless, as long as they're fresh.

The tang of the feta compliments the sweetness of the salad and the bitterness of the endive leaf, and the jewel tones of the beet and persimmon make for a beautiful bite. Choose persimmons with the texture of a ripe tomato, as an under-ripe persimmon is too tannic to eat and will ruin the dish.

If she balks at spiciness, on the other hand, replace the chile with a milder pepper, such as jalapeño, and remove the seeds and membranes. Or skip the hot stuff altogether—the sweetness and saltiness of the sauce will still be delicious.

The dessert itself is very simple: We bake an undocked, thick round of puff pastry, letting it puff up high, and serve it hot, filled with Orange-Scented Pastry Cream and topped with a buttery caramel sauce and a few Candied Pecans. The puff pastry rounds should be baked à la minute, never ahead of time, though the dough can be rolled out and cut in advance, and stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to a day. Sometimes the best desserts are the simplest.
5010110~Garbanzo Bean and Potato Fritters with Red Bell Pepper Harissa~3105~592~101~89~31~16152~0~There is a historical reason why most Hanukkah menus offer foods that have been fried in oil. In the second century B.C., a one-day supply of oil inexplicably burned for eight days and eight nights after Judah Maccabee and his followers recaptured Jerusalem's Holy Temple from their Syrian oppressors. Hanukkah is the celebration of that miracle, and fried foods are served to commemorate the oil. In this country, the Eastern European potato latke is usually featured. These fritters are a Sephardic contribution to that tradition.

5003000~Chicken Burritos~1550~175~27~59~70~7664~58~Los Angeles: land of sun, fun, and burritos. Southern California's Mexican-influenced cuisine has the potential to be an all-out fat fest (cheese, sour cream) or a healthy mix of carbs (tortillas, beans) and protein (chicken, beans). A chicken burrito with the full-fat works can tip the scales at nearly 600 calories and 31 fat grams. To slim it down, we stuffed it with all-white-meat chicken, less cheese and nonfat sour cream. We also rolled it in a whole-wheat tortilla for extra fiber.

We've tried several different brands in our test kitchens, and prefer the taste of Manhattan.* This recipe is modified from the classic one found on many condensed milk and Key lime juice labels; we've added additional lime juice for more tartness.

""It was a memorable night with good friends, great food and lots of wine. That night, cooking became my passion. And despite all of the effort, I still love to throw parties. My husband, Henry, and I host get-togethers once or twice a month. I do most of the preparation — admittedly that's because I enjoy cooking so much that I prefer to have the kitchen to myself. But I have to confess that since I started sharing the counter space, I've discovered we make a great team."""
5003023~Cosmopolitan Cranberry Sauce~887~236~236~0~0~0~0~This vibrant condiment takes its inspiration from the popular cocktail the Cosmopolitan.

I've made a version of it for years. At the culinary schools I attended in Chengdu recently, their technique of poaching the tofu, prior to stir-frying, to freshen and tenderize it was new to me, as was the wonderful effect of a lavish sprinkling of Sichuan-peppercorn powder.
5007418~Veal Cacciatore~1157~58~16~22~91~1150~51~Chicken cacciatore is a ubiquitous dish in Italian-American restaurants, but we think it is even more delicious when made with veal shoulder roast. Slowly braising the meat in a heady tomato sauce enriched with pancetta, olives, and porcini produces a dish so good, you'll find yourself sneaking nibbles all the way to the table. It's even better the next day—if you can contain yourself.

5003059~Pasta with Squid, Tomatoes, and Capers~1906~149~78~25~139~1125~27~There are two ways to get tender squid: a very quick sauté or a very long simmer.

No need to defrost before slicing and zipping them into the oven.

This blend has just the right amount of garlic and onion, with paprika for depth and a bit of dill for flavor. But we think it's the celery seed that really makes this one sing. See what you think.

To make it, you line a springform pan with a sweet short pastry, fill the crust with a chunky cooked apple filling studded with raisins and flavored with cinnamon and lemon, and then use the same crust dough to make a lid for the cake. I sometimes wonder if it isn’t the precursor to America’s apple pie, though in this cake, even after baking, the pastry remains soft and cakey thanks to the moist, cooked apple filling and a lemon glaze that is brushed on the top crust after baking.

5003221~Soup Doria~1792~95~32~60~129~11195~144~"When I worked in Gray Kunz's kitchens at Lespinasse, there was an honest-to-God Swiss princess living at the St. Regis Hotel. Her name was Princess Doria, and every night, she would phone down to the kitchen and tell us what she wanted to eat for dinner. In the beginning, Gray would cook for her himself: he was Swiss, she was Swiss, it was a whole Swiss thing going on. But after a while, he got tired of taking her calls, and the job devolved to me and the sous chefs. Every night, that phone would ring, and I would say, ""Good evening, Princess,"" and she would tell me what she wanted to eat that night. Princess Doria wasn't into super-fancy creative cooking: her thing was refined-but-homey. Some- times, for example, it would be a roast pintade for two: I would plate the breast for her, and the thighs for her cat. So I developed some dishes that were just for her. I named them after her: Salad Doria, Chicken Doria. And sometimes on cold winter nights, she would call down and say, ""Andrew, I would like some Soup Doria tonight, please."""

5003224~Glazed and Lacquered Roast Turkey~898~121~118~6~46~49682~126~A little soy sauce in the glaze ensures the burnished mahogany skin that holiday memories are made of. But it's not just for looks; this brined and buttered bird is seasoned inside and out.

5003227~Jollof Rice~1871~288~12~26~63~6788~9~This is the dish that first got me into cooking. Talking about it got me my first job in a kitchen, and together with the help of friends, local restaurants, and family it’s the recipe we have worked on the most for this book, because we all know how good it should be. If I could only eat one thing in the world it would probably be my grandma’s jollof. She would regularly cook a big pot with care and patience and insist that everyone took home a small container of it. Cooking the rice and storing it for the following day or to give to friends to take away is part of a sharing culture that surrounds jollof—just remember to return the Tupperware!
5003228~Buttermilk Spice Cake with Pear Compote and Crème Fraîche~4063~284~247~41~248~1830~1130~A light, tender cake thats perfectly spiced. Any leftovers would be delicious with coffee or tea the next day.

For dessert, serve mango sorbet or fresh pineapple and mango slices.

5003233~Shrimp and Artichokes in Peppery Butter Sauce~1273~62~6~56~83~1949~666~Highly recommended!
5003234~Sauteed Mushrooms with Smoked Ham~1059~76~12~4~76~1823~0~Traditionally, this flavorful sauté would be composed entirely of fresh cèpes (we know them better by their Italian name, porcini) gathered from the forests around Bordeaux.

5003239~Braised Chicken with Garlic and White Wine~1193~33~0~0~82~2995~0~The chicken is redolent of garlic, but not overly so; cooking the garlic cloves whole in their skins keeps the flavors in balance. What to drink: A spicy red from Spain's Ribera del Duero region. Try the 2000 vintage from this appellation, known for its rich blends of Tempranillo, Cabernet, and Merlot.

5003256~Lobster and Shrimp Bisque~1622~141~103~78~54~3485~738~Although bisques tend to be thick and creamy, the following intensely flavorful version is light, with very little cream added.
5003257~Superb English Plum Pudding~8573~1933~1123~113~58~4860~436~This pudding is really best when made a year in advance and allowed to mellow. It was customary to make it early in Advent — the religious season before Christmas — and use it the following year. Everyone in the family was supposed to stir the pudding once for good luck. If you can't make it the year before, at least give it a few weeks to age.
5003259~Spiced Beef Corn Bread Cobbler~1567~58~16~110~97~5373~321~Think of this dish as a sloppy joe with a corn bread and Cheddar crust — a welcome twist to an American classic.

5017787~Spiced Roast Chicken Breast~297~3~2~18~22~2724~45~This chicken makes a flavorful meal when combined with the Jasmine Rice and Carrot and Radish Salad . Steamed green beans and carrots would also make good sides.

5003271~Caramelized Onion and Sour Cream Spread~455~68~10~10~10~834~0~Leaping off the backs of onion-soup-mix boxes and showing up at cocktail parties everywhere, Lipton’s sour cream-and-onion dip took the country by storm. Convenient and quick, the dip also tasted great on potato chips, without which, in the fifties anyway, it wasn’t a party. These days it isn’t a party without little toasts topped by something Mediterranean-hence this zesty update.
5003272~Turkey Burritos with Salsa and Cilantro~1609~186~25~69~61~2622~141~The bold flavor of turkey is a natural with Mexican food.

5003279~Baked Sea Bass in Herbed Salt Crust~732~153~3~65~30~326500~0~This recipe produces a deliciously moist fish with a subtly salty flavor.
5003280~Slow-Cooker Beef and Two-Bean Chili~1545~222~91~57~47~9962~63~This chili pleases all palates in my house—it's not too spicy or too mild, but it's loaded with flavor. I love the combination of black beans and chickpeas, but you can use any type of legumes you like. What really makes the chili, in my opinion, are the toppings! Some sharp cheddar, a dollop of cumin-cilantro sour cream, and diced red onions are a must. Sometimes I even add some crushed tortilla chips.
5003281~Eggplant Manicotti with Ricotta, Asiago, and Spinach Filling~2550~86~38~107~196~4553~385~Here, eggplant stands in for the pasta.
5003282~Whole Branzino Roasted in Salt~1403~45~26~26~121~2839~14~Roasting the fish in salt makes it very moist — without, surprisingly, making it taste too salty. The lemony salsa verde adds zing and freshness that contrast nicely with the roasted fish.
5003283~Pasta Jambalaya~3008~392~28~204~74~2657~1321~Highly recommended!

5003287~Braised Short Ribs with Red Wine Gravy~3753~205~78~207~236~52010~477~Tiring of the ultra-refined nouvelle cuisine that epitomized eighties dining, cooks rediscovered the comforting humble cuts such as short ribs and shanks. Orecchiette pasta or mashed potatoes are great to catch the gravy.
5003288~Linguine with Carrot Ribbons and Lemon-Ginger Butter~1244~173~12~29~50~498~126~The carrot ribbons are simple: Use a vegetable peeler to make long strips.
5017978~Warm Peach Shortcakes with Bourbon-Brown Sugar Cream~6596~677~224~95~373~4483~594~Peaches sweetened with brown sugar fill pecan-studded biscuits — a southern-style twist on an all-American favorite.

5003297~Homemade Herbed Paneer Cheese~2528~220~204~63~157~1970~541~Serve this take on the traditional Indian fresh cheese with olive oil, salt, and pepper for a simple yet impressive appetizer. The tofu-like texture also works well folded into soups or curries or pan fried and tossed into salads.
5003298~Red Onion, Apple, and Raisin Chutney~1569~228~180~11~67~53~63~Highly recommended!
5003300~Ouzo-Marinated Melon with Prosciutto~323~8~8~32~16~2162~89~Ouzo lends a subtle flavor to the melon. Pour more over before serving, if desired.

5003303~Moroccan Vegetable Salad~1427~132~31~10~91~3405~17~An easy and fresh alternative to traditional green salads, this chilled North African-inspired dish combines potato, bell peppers, cucumbers, and olives with a light and tangy vinaigrette. Simple to prepare, it's great to double or triple for potlucks or group meals. Serve with the salad spread out on a large platter to let the colors and shapes of the ingredients shine. Make extra dressing to reinvigorate leftovers the next day. For a pretty variation, serve the salad garnished with sliced or diced cooked beets.
5015299~Best Friends Forever Brownies~4118~483~404~74~235~1284~600~After sampling hundreds of brownies in the Gourmet magazine test kitchens, along with baking countless more at home (my first was from the cult classic Betty Crocker's Cook Book for Boys and Girls), I feel qualified to declare my pride in this brownie. It's old-fashioned in its use of unsweetened chocolate, yet the addition of cocoa takes it to the deeper, darker chocolate place we crave these days.
5003305~Caramelized Pineapple with Brown Sugar-Ginger Ice Cream~946~248~246~0~0~1~0~Broiled pineapple is teamed with an easy-to-make ice cream and topped with toasted coconut for a tropical treat. The pineapple would also be good with purchased mango or coconut sorbet or with vanilla ice cream.
5003306~Cod with Chorizo and Breadcrumbs~914~32~6~26~75~1331~70~Adding vinegar to the chorizo topping cuts the richness of the sausage and brightens the entire dish.
5003307~Big Green Salad~498~17~13~4~46~613~17~Something green and crisp is in order, and this simple salad is just the thing. A tangy from-scratch honey-mustard dressing will make salad eaters out of even the youngest at the table.

5003311~Cheddar, Onion, and Red Bell Pepper Souffléd Omelet~2118~269~107~86~78~8428~131~We tested this recipe with a variety of cornmeal brands, all of which worked fine. Do not substitute polenta, however; it made the soufflé much too heavy.
5003312~Chicken with Ham, Fennel and Orange~550~43~9~18~27~1070~45~For a casual supper, broil rounds of prepared polenta roll, and toss romaine lettuce with oil and vinegar; end with cheesecake. For a special dinner, have broccoli spears with browned butter and orzo pilaf with Parmesan. Buy a hazelnut dacquoise or other fancy cake from the bakery for a great dessert.
5003313~Lobster and Shrimp Cioppino~5975~204~34~276~407~8702~2291~We recommend using a sturdy food mill (available at cookware stores) to help produce a thick stew base from simmered vegetables and fish. Alternatively, you can use a large heavy-duty mesh sieve to strain the seafood broth. Then push through enough fish and vegetables to make 13 cups of stew base. Serve cioppino with sourdough toasts.
5017352~Avocado Salsa~704~21~9~0~70~730~0~Highly recommended!
5003315~Pumpkin Spice Bundt Cake with Buttermilk Icing~4982~934~654~128~166~4136~799~When the pumpkin pie is gone, but you've only just begun to get your fill of pumpkin desserts, this bundt will fill the void quite nicely (and the somewhat more assertive spices will welcome the season ahead). Best of all, the flavors continue to develop and the cake tastes even better a few days after it's baked, so it's perfect to have on hand at this time of year, when guests tend to drop in unexpectedly.
5003316~Apple Crostata with Cheddar Cheese~3246~304~124~88~174~2214~527~Fuji or McIntosh apples work best for this tart; other varieties may be too juicy.
5003317~Fig and Sesame Tart with Cardamom Orange Cream~2988~506~305~87~123~879~337~Dried fruits and nuts are common in Moroccan pastries, but this tart is something special — the richness of the dough and the pop of the sesame seeds bring out that honeyed quality you normally associate with fresh figs. The cardamom cream is whisper-light, and the fresh orange segments are refreshingly cool.
5003318~Black Cod with Lime and Coconut~1650~244~38~57~43~4654~0~"Sheila Jacobs and Lynn Kramer of Abreu, Cabrera, Dominican Republic write: ""We're both from the U.S., but we have lived in the Dominican Republic for about 25 years. We're friends, business partners, and neighbors, so we entertain together often. Cooking the local dishes has made us feel a part of the country."""

5003321~Butternut Squash with Tangerine and Sage Glaze~2742~458~118~43~85~423~283~Squash with long, thin necks will yield uniform rounds when sliced and ensure even cooking.
5003322~Chicken with Endive, Radicchio and Balsamic Vinegar Glaze~745~69~57~20~44~1622~45~Easy to prepare and impressive to serve, this dish is perfect for an impromptu week-night dinner party.
5003323~Chicken Salad with Couscous~2097~376~171~60~40~3734~32~Lean, smoked chicken breast gets a special — and healthy — treatment in this creative mix. The couscous absorbs the citrus juices (or use quinoa for extra protein — it has the highest amount of all the grains) for a tartness that plays well off the sweetness of the grapes. The bed of arugula is more than merely dish dressing: It's high in calcium and magnesium, making it a bone builder.
5006726~New England Molasses Gingerbread Cookies~11652~2073~1034~290~205~8374~690~Rather than being crisp, these heirloom cookies are tender and cake-like.
5003326~Pizza with Leeks, Tomato and Goat Cheese~1369~228~31~108~75~2869~106~If you have a set of clay tiles or a baking stone, place it on the oven rack while preheating the oven. It will absorb the heat, and putting a pizza pan or baking sheet directly on top will ensure a crisp crust.

5003331~Mustardy Kale with Bacon~1458~149~5~83~67~2621~125~Sharp mustard adds edginess to the old standby combination of greens and bacon.
5003332~Micro-Quick Hot-Sweet Salad of Broccoli Raab and Carrots~896~58~45~7~69~1876~8~I'm not a big fan of microwaving, but in this case, it preserves both vegetables' deep color and nutrients as it speeds cooking. The honey and sweet sherry accents temper the bitter broccoli raab for a side dish that's fast, fresh, pretty.
5003333~Rintaro's Beef Curry~2935~229~70~227~108~8689~642~To develop deep, satisfying flavor in this home-style stew, brown the beef slowly and thoroughly, and cook the onions until very soft and jammy.

""I order it every time I go there. Do you think chef Dan Swinney would part with his recipe?"""

At the restaurant, we use it to season everything from corn on the cob to chicken to our Spring booty taco. When cooking with it, just beware that it's quite salty. Also, it keeps for a long time, which means that you may want to make a double batch.

5003468~Ginger Slaw~1107~38~19~5~101~2169~126~The slaw should be chilled at least 4 hours before serving. Ginger can be sliced thinly and chopped in a mini-chopper.

5003475~New York Strip Roast With Rosemary-Orange Crust and Herbed Butter~2107~140~45~18~155~10479~300~You'll be surprised by just how easy it is to pull off this super-impressive flavor-packed holiday roast.
5003476~Grilled Pork Chops with Cherry Relish~306~18~6~28~14~4571~45~The relish is also a delicious complement to grilled lamb or chicken.
5003477~Pork and Sausage Sauté~7028~865~71~408~224~18144~666~This delicious Portuguese regional specialty, called migas, is a dish of sautéed meats served over fried bread. Here is the version from Fialho restaurant in Evora, Portugal. They marinate the pork in a red-pepper paste popular in the Alentejo, but paprika makes a nice substitute. The seasoned pork needs to be chilled overnight, so begin this recipe a day before serving it.
5019916~Bacon-Balsamic Vinaigrette~1389~41~33~30~122~1470~115~Highly recommended!
5003479~Melon with Green-Peppercorn Raspberry Sauce~515~98~86~1~13~7~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5003480~Trout Choucroute~1532~105~58~50~95~6317~262~This dish takes the best of traditional choucroute garni—smoked pork married to sauerkraut that's had its bite removed by being simmered in wine with bay and juniper—and lightens it up, pairing it with another Alsatian favorite, trout, and transforming a stick-to-the-ribs dish into something fit for a first course. You'll be pleasantly surprised at how the slight acidity of the kraut and the smokiness of the bacon play up, rather than dominate, the fish's clean flavor.
5003481~Fusilli with Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Zucchini, and Peas~1173~175~33~31~17~602~44~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5003484~Chocolate Cherry Cola Cake~5685~1179~1164~15~129~213~377~I love to celebrate birthdays with the crew and my bandmates. When we're on the road, it's nice to have the band family celebrate. Jimi's birthday falls at the end of October, and I sometimes make this silly chocolate cherry cola cake for him, decorating the top with chocolate cherry cordials or gummy candies. I always let him choose what he's got a hankering for, and it's often this.
5003485~Sautéed Halibut with Arugula, Roasted Beets, and Horseradish Crème Fraîche~878~9~5~19~84~881~18~The colored beets and bright green arugula in this dish make for a visually stunning presentation. The sweet roasted beets marinated in lemon vinaigrette play off the pure white fish and horseradish cream. Look for a few different types of beets, such as golden beets and Chioggia beets, and dress them separately, so the dark ones don't bleed their juices onto the lighter ones. In the spring, you could make this dish with wild salmon.
5003486~Whipped Sweet Potatoes with Nutmeg and Lemon~932~19~15~0~92~760~253~Highly recommended!
5013851~Apple Pithivier~2702~346~304~21~136~865~383~"When I started working at Payard Pâtisserie in New York City, I had already been a pastry chef in Boston for a few years. I couldn't wait to see what this French guy could teach me. On my first day, I was handed a stack of recipes—all in French—and immediately realized it would be a challenging year. I spoke and read basic French, but I was pretty hazy on much of the baking vocabulary, and there were many words I'd never even seen before. Pithivier was one of them. I didn't even know how to pronounce it. (It's pee-tee-vee-YAY .) ""Watch and learn,"" Chef Payard told me. He sandwiched a mound of rum-scented almond cream between two large squares of homemade puff pastry and then quickly scalloped the edges of the pastry to look like a sunflower. Slash-slash-slash went his paring knife over the top pastry as he etched sun rays into the surface. The whole thing went into the oven and emerged golden brown with a glorious starburst pattern on top. It put every other pastry I had ever made previously to shame."
5018446~Mint Tea~753~193~156~0~0~0~0~"""Anyone who has spent time in any North African country has stories about mint tea so sweet that the glass sticks to their lips,"" says Zadi. His version, though a strong tea, is light on the sweetening."

5003491~"Toasted Barley and Asparagus ""risotto"""~7433~906~32~552~81~402001~212~Risotto, by definition, is made with rice. But other grains—like the barley in this main-course recipe—can be prepared in the same style with equally terrific results. Toasting the barley enhances its nutty flavor and keeps it from getting soft and mushy.
5017183~Pork Pot Stickers~1227~126~11~27~63~41571~22~Chef Ming Tsai created this recipe for Epicurious's Wine.Dine.Donate program. Serve the potstickers with his dim sum dipper and cranberry-teriyaki glaze.
5003493~Cucumber-Watercress Relish~395~36~26~1~27~27~0~The cool flavors in this relish would be great with tuna or shrimp.

5003496~Frozen Peanut Butter Pie with Candied Bacon~4591~248~224~96~374~1832~750~Candied bacon might seem like the ultimate example of gilding the lily, but it adds a sweet, smoky edge to this already luscious pie. Elvis would be proud.

5003500~Spicy Pork and Mustard Green Soup~1997~287~11~53~66~6941~132~It might look like a lot when the greens are raw, but add them all anyway. They'll quickly wilt down to a silky texture.
5003501~Rosemary Pork Chops~55~14~14~0~0~0~0~"It's funny how family sayings get picked up by friends. When I was around ten and my sister was about five, we were acting up at the dinner table. My daddy had worked a long hard day, and when he couldn't take another minute of our shenanigans, he pushed his chair back, folded his dinner napkin, and left the table. Totally unaffected by his frustration, my innocent little sister immediately piped up: ""Can I have Daddy's pork chop?"" I've often told friends that funny tale over the years. Now when I serve pork chops and someone wants seconds they'll chime in, ""Can I have Daddy's pork chop?"""
5003502~Chocolate Grasshopper Ice Cream Tart~1586~122~71~22~119~424~292~It’s crucial that this tart be frozen solid before slicing. If you are in and out of your freezer a lot, that may take longer than one day; err on the safe side!

5003523~Sweet Potato Biscuits~1642~180~125~26~59~5601~0~Highly recommended!
5003524~Brazilian Fish Stew (Moqueca Capixaba)~1003~85~54~28~62~5098~194~We usually encounter only one version of Brazil's signature dish in this country — the one from Bahia, rich and almost currylike with coconut milk and dendê oil. This lighter one, from Espírito Santo, reflects that state's long coastline: Its bright broth results from the fish, tomatoes, lime juice, and vegetables, which meld beautifully. And it couldn't be easier. You simply layer the marinated seafood with the other ingredients in a cold pan and turn up the heat, simmering for just 20 minutes.
5003525~Fried Green Olives Stuffed with Blue Cheese~829~89~5~26~9~549~32~**What to drink:**A glass of bubbly would be perfect with the olives. Try Domaine Chandon Brut Classic (California, $20).
5003526~Pasta With Roasted Romanesco and Capers~2226~307~12~67~76~1714~112~Broccoli would be just as good in this pasta recipe, as would diced winter squash such as butternut or acorn.

5016633~Chocolate Peppermint Stars~523~67~52~7~29~224~22~If you've been looking for a chocolate sugar cookie that doesn't wimp out, delivering the dark chocolate hit you crave, this is the one for you. The thin coating of melted bittersweet chocolate, along with a festive sprinkle of crushed candy canes, only enhances the depth of flavor inherent in the cookie's deep brown color.
5003531~Bacon-Cheddar Muffins~4101~555~142~121~188~15169~883~For perfectly browned tops, cook one pan at a time on the topmost oven rack.
5003532~Fettuccine with Preserved Tuna, Capers, and Olives~3369~400~70~161~92~2983~270~I grew up in a household where we didn't eat meat on Friday, which presented a problem because when I was a child, I didn't like most fish or shellfish. My mother solved this dilemma by making me pasta with canned tuna and tomato sauce. This is my adult version of that recipe, made with high-quality preserved tuna with capers and anchovies added to hit the notes one expects in such a classic seafood pasta.
5003533~Mesclun Salad with Veggies, Goat Cheese, and Crispy Garlic~7292~800~557~108~410~8219~370~Fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff shared this recipe for one of her favorite salads—it's an updated take on a salad her Mom made when she was growing up in San Diego. We've included quantities for all the ingredients, but Minkoff encourages you to make this dish your own and to taste as you go.
5003534~Sautéed Snow Peas, Sugar Snap Peas, and Pea Shoots~1375~183~58~38~14~1485~2~This summer side cooks quickly, so the veggies retain their nutrients.
5005007~Red Mole~2943~179~63~70~229~5229~30~Canela, a Latin American cousin of cinnamon, is a leading player in this sauce. Once used by affluent Romans in love potions and perfumes, the spice, derived from the inner bark of a tropical evergreen, is hugely popular in New World cuisine, in everything from soups to desserts.
5003536~Verbena-Brined Pork Chops~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~Brining these pork chops keeps them plump and juicy, but if lemon verbena for the brine isn't readily available, you can leave it out. Its subtle flavor probably won't be missed, especially if you serve the chops with the distinctly lemony hoppin' John risotto.
5018279~Chocolate-Dipped Spritz Washboards with Pistachios~2184~368~322~24~79~392~39~Although the origins of spritz cookies are fuzzy—some say they come from Scandinavia, while others cite Germany—I'm inclined to believe it's the latter, because spritzen means to squirt in German, which is how these cookies are formed: The dough is squirted from a cookie press. You can make any shape you want, but we love these old-fashioned washboard strips. If the idea of yet another piece of kitchen equipment deters you, rest assured these cookies are so delicious, you'll be baking them more than once a year. A cookie press is not expensive and with all the different shapes you can make from the dough, it will more than pay for itself in fun and entertainment over the years for the child in all of us.
5003538~Spiced Beef Patties with Couscous~237~15~9~0~21~889~0~"Robert Colombi of Paris, France, writes: ""My mother was Sicilian and my father, Corsican, but I was born in Morocco and lived there for many years. I learned how to cook mostly from my mother, but also from my many travels throughout Morocco (which is why my favorite spices are coriander, thyme, and cumin). As I became older, I developed a stronger interest in cooking, especially after I moved to France and got married. I guess I started to feel very nostalgic about the country of my childhood, and it became more important for me to remember and re-create those tastes for my French friends and family."""

5003544~Pickled Sugar Snap Peas~471~102~37~10~0~8404~0~The best way to eat sugar snap peas is right off the vine. This recipe ranks a close second, though. I pickle any sugar snap peas that the kids don't eat right away, and continue to enjoy them for weeks after the pea vines have wilted away.

5003551~Iced Almond Latte~492~88~82~11~11~354~42~Look for almond syrup in the coffee and tea section of the supermarket. The drink is even better topped with the Espresso Whipped Cream.

5003556~Chilled Pea Broth with Lemon Cream~547~25~14~4~48~4080~0~We think bowls made of ice are the perfect vessel for this soup, but if space is tight in your freezer, regular soup bowls will work just fine.

5003565~Pork Roast with Black Bean Sauce~2537~212~104~49~168~3547~58~Marinating the pork in citrus juices gives it a flavor that is perfectly complemented by the slightly spicy sauce. If you cannot find plantains, use ripe bananas.
5003566~Parmesan-Roasted Butternut Squash~1123~133~26~13~70~58~235~The best qualities of a gratin shine in this incredibly simple side dish: Pieces of sweet butternut squash and a flurry of salty Parmigiano-Reggiano meld with cream to form a warm, cohesive whole.
5003569~Chicken Bone Broth~3877~1219~287~25~10~477~370~This is how we make chicken bone broth at home. If you'd like, you can switch out the herbs and vegetables for others you prefer. For example, you could add leeks, celery, or a different type of onion. Roast the vegetables first for added depth of flavor and color.

5016867~Mustard Cream Sauce~934~7~3~0~78~1621~314~Highly recommended!
5003595~Pico de Gallo with Lemon Zest (Pico de gallo con limón amarillo)~99~14~11~2~2~3042~0~Pico de gallo, also known as salsa Mexicana, has become a common sight on tables in the U.S. and it's easy to see why. The mixture of raw, chopped ingredients improves just about any meal with its lively acidity, lip-tingling heat, and crisp texture. This version is a riff on the classic that swaps lemon for lime to great effect. Whenever I take a bite I have a heretical thought: This is so delicious that maybe we Mexicans should use only lemons!
5003597~Mozzarella, Tomato, and Ham Layered Sandwiches~811~88~14~78~32~2989~143~Highly recommended!
5003598~Smoked Salmon with Sour Cream-Caper Sauce~158~5~0~16~7~784~46~A simple but elegant cold dish. The sauce can be made a day in advance.

5006593~Lemon-Tahini Sauce~1024~51~6~31~70~1555~0~When I tasted this sauce in Jerusalem a few years ago, I was reminded of how much I like the earthy taste of sesame tahini and the brightness of parsley—stems and all.
5003601~Broccoli-Cheese Soup~5192~152~122~223~401~7924~1361~Broccoli-cheese soup is my life. There’s something about it that triggers a happy, peaceful memory. I just don’t know what the memory is. So I guess technically, it isn’t really a memory at all. I think a memory, by definition, is something that someone actually has to remember.
5003603~Pork with Prunes~4205~358~189~181~224~7441~490~Highly recommended!
5003605~Roast Chicken with Herb Butter, Onions and Garlic~1280~56~9~16~96~3622~283~Serve this with the Crispy Potato Galette, buttered green beans and a red Côtes du Rhône or white Burgundy.
5003606~Singapore Slings~709~129~127~0~0~11~0~Heavily spiked, our take on the Singapore Sling highlights the aromatic quality of Benedictine, a Cognac-based liqueur that smells of honey, citrus, and herbs.
5003607~Candied Carrot Coins~148~37~35~1~0~77~0~These will be sweet and chewy when done and are the perfect decorations for BA's Best Carrot Cake.
5003608~Crème Fraîche Cheesecake with Honey-Rum-Roasted Pineapple~3872~605~477~36~148~1529~749~Tangy crème fraîche and a very grown-up rum-pineapple topping take cheesecake to an entirely new level. For best results, use Philadelphia-brand cream cheese.
5018729~Brandied Dried Cranberries and Cherries~1191~274~236~0~5~46~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less. To accompany Ice-Cream Bombes with Brandied Dried Cranberries and Cherries
5003610~Avocado Toast with Tomato-Corn Salsa~1475~250~13~43~33~972~10~Tomatoes and fresh corn salsa add a Mexican twist to the classic avocado toast. To add a smoky flavor to the mix, grill the corn first.
5003611~Layered Nacho Salad~2713~89~26~177~202~10037~693~Make the salad in a clear glass bowl to show off the colors. Pass some purchased red wine vinaigrette or buttermilk dressing alongside.
5003612~The Ladybug (Watermelon Drink)~438~130~96~0~3~178~2~Highly recommended!

5003614~Baked French Toast with Pecan Crumble~3665~259~246~44~291~3219~1122~Drying out the challah lets it absorb the custard without going to mush. You can also use brioche.
5003615~Apple-Pear Cobbler with Cheddar Crust~5971~1193~641~68~108~2280~350~Highly recommended!
5003616~Black Pepper Spice-Rubbed Beef Tenderloin~226~0~0~0~25~2423~0~Here, handsome and crowd-pleasing beef tenderloin is first rubbed with an Indian-inspired combination of spices—cardamom, mustard, and others work in concert with the nuanced heat of black peppercorns—and then seared to form a fragrant, inviting crust. Finishing it in a moderate oven results in a roast that is evenly rosy, juicy, and as delicious as it is beautiful. Like the bulgur with herbs and the bevy of beans and basil , it can be served at room temperature.
5003617~Creamed Corn with Basil~349~26~12~2~24~2162~63~Highly recommended!
5013639~Corn Bread for Stuffing~2190~389~25~89~56~4072~126~The following corn bread is not to be eaten on its own; it's meant for stuffing, so we've deliberately made it dry.
5004718~Spicy Tomato Barbecue Sauce~1297~180~124~5~73~5044~26~Highly recommended!
5003620~Spring Greens with Smoked Fish and Herbed Aioli~1095~43~6~11~96~242~4~Highly recommended!
5003621~Blended Vodka Daiquiris with Lime and Mint~854~245~127~1~9~424~7~Highly recommended!
5003622~Roast Pork Tenderloin with Carrot Romesco~1602~119~62~37~112~1216~45~Romesco is to Spain what pesto is to Italy. Typically made with red peppers, this carrot version led to some new ideas.
5003623~Sloppy Tacos~2765~145~33~206~143~2539~599~The only thing better than Sloppy Joes for dinner is taco night. This hybrid is the best of both worlds.
5003624~Roast Rack of Lamb with Natural Jus~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~A rack of lamb, being a red meat, is roasted to a lower internal temperature than chicken, veal, or pork, meaning that it releases little in the way of juices during the roasting process. To supplement the jus, spread the roasting pan with the trimmings from the rack (with the fat trimmed off) or a pound or so of lamb stew meat cut into small pieces and brown these in a hot oven before setting the rack on top. The flavor of the jus can also be accentuated by caramelizing the juices once or more after deglazing as described above for the saddle of lamb.
5003625~Shrimp and Andouille Sausage Gumbo~4421~288~13~294~231~9323~2056~Highly recommended!
5003626~Broiled Salmon Steaks~236~0~0~0~27~0~0~Broiled salmon steaks are superfast, ultrahealthy, and often on our dinner tables. Here's how to get 'em' right—and keep them interesting.

5003630~Pasta with Butternut Squash and Lima Beans~2747~368~5~147~52~95367~59~Highly recommended!
5003631~Apple Torte with Breadcrumb-Hazelnut~3135~369~173~36~168~661~210~The delicious breadcrumb crust was probably created when white flour wasn't readily available in Friuli.
5018740~Blackberry-Mint Syrup~385~98~77~1~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5003633~Grilled Zucchini Pasta with Pecorino Walnut Crumble~1828~130~22~67~115~3345~320~Crumb toppings normally appear on fruit desserts, but a savory mixture of grated pecorino and toasted walnuts works in much the same way, adding textural contrast to delicate fettuccine and grilled zucchini. Garlic-chile oil jazzes up the flavor.
5004778~Frozen Blackberry-Cream Pops~1099~187~145~15~35~294~177~To prepare these without an ice cream maker, pour the sherbet base directly into pop molds. If you don't want to use the molds and you have churned the mixture in an ice cream maker, the sherbet can be transferred to a resealable container, then simply scooped into bowls. Begin making this dessert one day ahead.
5003635~Coffee-Glazed Doughnuts~24081~829~466~158~2450~3827~246~Anyone who's ever dropped into a local bakery for a morning snack can testify to the appeal of coffee and a doughnut. Here, yeast doughnuts with a touch of cinnamon get an extra jolt of flavor from a sweet espresso glaze.
5003636~Macaroni with Cream and Cheese~1559~143~24~23~97~4178~158~Macarrones con Crema y Queso
5003637~Skewered Grilled Fruit with Minted Yogurt Honey Sauce~663~162~101~2~0~7~0~Highly recommended!
5003638~Open-Face Chicken Burgers with Basil Mayonnaise~2763~75~20~91~256~8166~604~For tender burgers, gently combine and shape the chicken mixture.
5003639~Cabbage with Shredded Pork-Chinese Style~2274~89~54~118~164~8391~363~Pork may be overcooked a little, but don't overcook the vegetables. They should retain good color and texture.
5003640~Classic Manhattan Clam Chowder~460~96~26~8~4~3293~0~"New Englanders find the very idea of tomatoes in clam chowder to be abhorrent; of course, by referring to the aberration as ""Manhattan clam chowder"" they're overlooking the fact that their own Rhode Islanders also add tomatoes to clam chowder. And let's not forget about the hundreds of ethnic cuisines around the world that combine tomatoes with shellfish in soups and stews. Unlike the New England purists, we just don't find an intrinsic problem with clams and tomatoes. We do find, however, that most Manhattan clam chowder served in restaurants is positively awful: thin, unclammy, often tasting like vegetable soup out of a can with a few canned clams thrown in. Try the following recipe, and you'll see how good this soup can be."
5003641~Lime-Marinated Onions With Pine Nuts and Mint~399~79~3~0~0~0~0~These flavorful marinated onions also make a great condiment for grilled steak.
5003642~Fried Chickpeas and Spiced Nuts with Olives and Radishes~1443~64~32~16~0~730~0~Highly recommended!

5004502~Tapenade Butter~935~53~33~14~68~1380~173~"This recipe is an accompaniment for <edit:recipelink id=""230642"">Sausage-Wrapped Lamb Chops</edit:recipelink>."
5003645~Olive Focaccia with Pancetta and Onion Topping~2757~359~9~105~65~3119~25~Fast-rising yeast makes this bread a snap to prepare. A dry red wine, like Chianti, is ideal with this Italian-accented menu.
5011639~Mashed Potatoes with Kale~7600~1400~304~145~135~42357~281~This version of colcannon, usually a combination of buttery mashed potatoes and cabbage, is a wonderful accompaniment to grilled sausages or Beef Stew with Stout .
5003647~Grape and Rosemary Focaccia~4333~780~37~135~71~1938~0~Highly recommended!
5019207~Fresh-Herb Dumplings~1925~287~23~59~47~499~482~Celery leaves (which are left over from the celery used in the soup) are great in the dumplings.

5003653~Pasta with Lentil Bolognese~3266~561~79~138~45~4464~31~Highly recommended!
5003655~Dark Chocolate Ganache~5327~390~303~43~440~1457~973~Highly recommended!
5003656~Chicken and Corn Chowder with Thyme~3313~446~26~122~116~4903~382~Complement the delicious soup with biscuits and a spinach and red bell pepper salad. Top it all off with some sliced sweetened plums spooned over vanilla ice cream.
5003657~Buckwheat Crepes with Honeyed Ricotta and Sautéed Plums~3042~468~226~75~64~1535~461~My friend Keena lives less than a mile away and has a plum tree she can't keep up with. In early fall, she makes jam with as many plums as she can and sends me home with a big grocery bag full of them every time I see her. I'm not much of a canner, so I began sautéing them and using them as a topping for yogurt and porridge, and as a filling for these simple buckwheat crepes. While buckwheat groats have a pretty distinct flavor and can be a hard sell for many folks, buckwheat flour is commonly used and adored in both sweet and savory crepes. For this recipe, use oval-shaped Italian plums (or prune plums) if you can; they're nice and firm and lend themselves well to sautéing—or just plain snacking.
5003658~Red Lion~279~93~6~0~0~2~0~Highly recommended!
5003659~Carrot Soup with Sesame Seeds and Chives~1780~128~73~22~127~5944~315~Highly recommended!
5003661~Hot Toddy Pick-Me-Up~1432~246~206~7~37~1506~27~The hot toddy is not simply a mixture of hot water and booze. It's a miracle worker, a doctor, and a life coach in a cup. And although it does seem to do the trick for everything from a sore throat to a cough, it's just as good when you're healthy. This version—from Damon Boelte, bar manager at Prime Meats restaurant in Brooklyn—omits the usual honey or sugar and plays up the herbal and spicy notes instead.
5003662~Gratin of Butternut Squash~1405~11~2~18~154~2720~515~Butternut is one of my favorite squashes. We often bake a small butternut squash (about 1 pound) at home; we split it lengthwise, seed it, score the flesh with a knife, sprinkle on a little salt, and bake, skin side down, for 1 hour in a 400-degree oven. Excellent in soup and pureed, butternut squash is always welcome at our table. This gratin is quite rich and should be reserved for special occasions, like Thanksgiving.
5003663~One-Pan Roast Chicken, Fennel, and Root Vegetables~863~82~20~8~56~2299~0~Serve a salad and some wine alongside, and you're ready for company.
5003664~"""Paella"" Fried Rice"~3960~780~8~70~66~4440~0~Remember, you absolutely cannot make delicious fried rice using freshly cooked rice! If you cook the rice yourself (a day to a week ahead), buy long-grain (Carolina) rice and follow the package directions for making drier rice.
5003665~Easy Steak Sauce with Seared Hanger Steak~835~128~65~0~47~3276~0~A steak sauce good enough to rival the most popular brand makes this steak (or any, really) even more delicious.
5003666~Sweet Potato Stuffing with Bacon and Thyme~13055~2320~344~417~219~50699~548~Pair with the Clementine-Salted Turkey with Redeye Gravy .

5003679~Plum-Glazed Turkey~959~113~106~13~47~1219~160~Roasting the turkey under foil for the first 1 1/2 hours infuses lots of moisture and flavor into the bird.

5003684~Spirited Pumpkin Pie~4249~512~234~50~203~2137~849~"Pumpkin pies have long been favored in New England; there is a recipe for a ""pompkin"" pie in Amelia Simmons's 1796 American Cookery. New England colonists, in spite of their puritanical reputation, were known to enjoy a tot of rum now and then. And if the liquor was hidden in a pie, even the ladies were able to indulge."
5003685~Apricot Tart with Cornmeal Crust~4978~839~383~65~139~1844~387~"""On a recent trip to the Napa Valley, my husband and I had lunch with friends in the Cask Room at Merryvale Vineyards in St. Helena,"" writes Karen G. Shughart of Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. ""The meal was prepared by Knickerbocker's Catering. Desserts must be their specialty, because the apricot tart with cornmeal crust was fabulous."""

5003701~Italian Fruitcakes with Frangelico Chocolate Sauce~12990~1547~723~212~673~2253~1113~Italian fruitcakes with Frangelico chocolate sauce If you don't have the mini Bundt molds called for, oversize muffin cups (about one-cup capacity) can be used instead. Begin preparing this at least a week ahead.
5003702~Molasses Cookies~6472~1280~875~187~206~4066~584~Highly recommended!
5003703~Blue Cheese Souffles with Grape Syrup on Fig and Walnut Brioche~4064~238~193~79~311~4738~1271~This recipe isn't easy, but if you're looking for the wow factor, here it is. Coming at the end of the meal, the dish reprises the flavor of the stuffed dates because each bite packs enormous punch as the sweet, savory, and acidic flavors come rushing forward.
5003704~Roasted Pork Loin with Cardamom-Currant Jelly Sauce~6712~701~560~185~319~10596~526~Roasted pork loin, which is commonly served on special occasions in Denmark, is here richly flavored with cardamom, juniper berries and currant jelly. Ask the butcher to cut into the chine bone of the rib roast to make it easier to carve. Note that the pork needs to marinate at least 12 hours before roasting, so plan accordingly. Uncork a fruity Merlot to go with it.

5003708~Rib-Eye Steaks in Red-Wine Sauce~1373~33~0~69~118~2826~313~"The act of deglazing—using a liquid to ""release"" pan drippings—is the tried-and-true trick to getting a quick, flavorful sauce. The soy in this recipe melds wonderfully with the wine and adds a certain depth."
5003709~Pernod-Marinated New Zealand Mussels with Chervil Oil~2400~33~0~384~64~6885~1280~If fresh chervil is unavailable in your area, substitute fresh basil leaves for the oil and garnish the mussels with tiny basil leaves.
5003710~Dean & Deluca's Tuna Sandwich with Carrots, Red Onion, and Parsley~635~118~20~15~6~1039~10~We sympathize with the purists when it comes to tuna salad sandwiches: the combo of canned tuna, just a little mayo, and just good white bread is an eternal verity. But we have developed this fancier variation that is also delicious. It preserves the tuna flavor, it's not too rich, it's loaded with crunchy vegetables, and it flies out of the store every day.
5003712~Linguine with Red Clam Sauce~2873~445~60~107~76~4969~166~Highly recommended!
5003713~Milk Chocolate-Peanut Butter Sandwich Cookies~5074~430~97~98~326~3033~326~Be sure to use regular peanut butter — not old-fashioned or freshly ground — for the best consistency in the cookie batter and the filling.

5003718~Honeyed Red-Onion Confit~1931~375~328~15~44~59~0~In this confit, called tfaya, all the ingredients blend together, taking on a melting softness as well as the distinct notes of honey. Added to savory dishes like the couscous or even the lamb, it provides an unexpected brightness along with the sweetness.
5003719~Petrale Sole with Lemon-Shallot Brussels Sprouts~1393~137~15~62~52~48805~31~To prepare the brussels sprouts before cutting them, be sure to pull off the tough outer leaves. Thin slicing and simple seasonings will convert those who aren't fans of brussels sprouts. Petrale sole, a Pacific Coast fish, is prized for its delicate flavor and thick fillets.
5003720~Shrimp Boil With Spicy Horseradish Sauce~1789~180~26~159~41~5897~1321~What's for dinner? A big ol' heap of Louisiana, in the form of potatoes, corn, and shrimp. It's all here, it couldn't be easier, and dipping everything in the spicy sauce while you sip a cold beer is pretty much the perfect thing to do on a steamy summer evening.
5003721~Green Bean and Red Onion Salad~325~16~8~1~27~27~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5003723~Marbled Chocolate and Strawberry Galettes~4854~591~211~70~234~1612~577~The chocolate topping on this striking rectangular tart is very rich, so a small serving of the dessert goes a long way.
5015548~Chestnut, Prune, and Pancetta Stuffing~1806~219~110~27~89~3805~584~There's lots of bold flavor in this hearty stuffing, which, though inspired by a classic Italian combination, happens to work in perfect concert with everything on the American holiday table. Baking it in a wide dish yields plenty of crusty top for everyone.
5003725~Sausage and Feta Phyllo Triangles~3048~108~13~90~243~5699~856~Highly recommended!

5003729~Pork Roast with Winter Fruits and Port Sauce~2295~226~104~35~134~2498~329~Ever dream about bringing an impressive roast to the holiday table with equally impressive ease? Now you can. Stuffing and preparing the pork a day ahead leaves you free to entertain and makes the meat especially flavorful as well. Bacon wrapped around the roast keeps it moist as it cooks. Prunes and dried apricots simmered in Port bring a fruity but not overly sweet intensity to the pork and its sauce.

5006624~Pizza Crust~1138~375~3~168~0~4846~0~I love Jim Lahey's crust because it's thin, crispy, and so very reliable. I can't ever remember a night where it didn't work. When we're feeling healthy, we replace the white flour with whole wheat flour-if you want to be sneaky about it with the kids, you can start by just replacing half with whole wheat flour. We usually use one ball of dough for one dinner and then freeze the extra for another dinner later. To thaw, remove from freezer about two to three hours before using and work it with your hands if it's still stiff.

""But when I was young, it was customary to vacation on the Mediterranean coast in the summer, where you go to the market every day to see what's good, and everything is really fresh and light. Even the fat is good, since it's usually olive oil. This recipe is based on dishes from that region."""

5003761~Garlicky Blender Aioli~1542~46~4~22~142~376~4~There are a lot of aioli recipes out there. This one uses a coddled egg instead of raw, and the blender method ensures a successful emulsion.
5003762~Short Rib and Vegetable Stew~2808~503~88~598~349~23628~1944~"""Koreans are short rib masters,"" says Chou, who lived and cooked in Korea for several years. ""It's their favorite cut."" While some ribs are sliced thin, marinated, and grilled, others are reserved for stews and soups. Kalbi jjim, one of the countrys best-known concoctions, shares some ingredients with a European beef stewnamely, carrots, onions, and potatoes—but here the brothy, slightly sweet dish gets its robust undertones from dried mushrooms, soy sauce, fish sauce, and molasses, plus a dollop of hot red-pepper paste. Though it is rustic-looking, the meat's tenderness and the broths amazing depth make clear why this dish is a national treasure."

5003769~Herb-Crusted Grilled Lamb with Apricot Relish~1858~173~83~27~116~11198~120~"The lamb top roast is one of the three ""subprimal"" cuts that can be cut from the leg of lamb. The equivalent of the beef top round roast, but smaller and more tender, it provides a succulent boneless lamb roast when you don't want to deal with a whole leg."
5003770~Roast Turkey with Prosciutto, Rosemary and Garlic~1111~98~3~78~24~6448~233~A mixture of prosciutto, rosemary and plenty of garlic rubbed under the skin of the turkey gives it a distinctively delicious taste.

Begin the meal with an appetizer of chilled shrimp with lemon and dill, and offer a radicchio salad as a first course. Pour a Chianti Classico Riserva.

5003779~Gochujang-Braised Chicken and Crispy Rice~4122~691~73~79~106~8021~216~Long-grain rice is not starchy enough to hold together, so make a batch of short-grain a day ahead and you’ll be good to go.

5003785~Watermelon Jell-O Shots~661~59~31~100~0~1084~0~If you were a sporty type at school, you may remember those little orange slices that were given out at half time during matches. A momentary respite from jumping and leaping in the air on a cold windy netball court in the depths of winter seems to be a vivid memory from my early teenage years. Naturally, giving you a recipe for orange slices may have proven uninspiring so, with a bit of cooking magic, I would like to introduce you to my watermelon Jell-O shots… A happy walk down memory lane with a very modern twist. For an alcoholic version, replace 1/2 cup of the water with some vodka.
5003786~Kefta and Zucchini Kebabs~920~143~55~19~25~4307~53~With these distinctly Middle Eastern kebabs, the minty coolness of the yogurt sauce offsets the allspice, pepper, and cinnamon in some of the most succulent and juicy meatballs you have ever tasted.

5003795~Buckwheat Pancakes with Smoked Salmon~1517~116~19~62~125~1318~652~This version of blini—a tribute to the Russian communities throughout the New York metropolitan area—is fast because it does not require yeast. If buckwheat flour is unavailable, whole-wheat flour makes a good substitute.
5018356~White Chicken Chili~1608~155~7~106~60~7518~300~Whether you call this dish a chili or hearty chicken and bean stew, it's definitely a winner. The first time I made it for my kids, they asked me so many times what it was called, but by the end of the meal they cared much more about getting second helpings than remembering the name! If you have time be sure to double the recipe and store in the fridge or freezer, because, like most soups and stews, the leftovers are amazing.

5011384~Grilled Corn with Roasted Garlic Butter~1759~40~5~1~172~1190~316~Grilling husked corn on the cob produces nicely browned and sweetly caramelized kernels that are absolutely addictive. The garlic butter is a terrific finishing touch.

5003845~Dijon and Tarragon Grilled Chicken~258~11~11~0~13~1793~0~Tarragon and mustard may be a classic French combination, but this menu is all American. A domestic Chardonnay, light beer, or fresh lemonade are perfect partners.

5003811~Avocado Salad with Bell Pepper and Tomatoes~1267~186~58~37~47~42057~71~Avocado shells make handy vessels for a bright salad made with the scooped-out flesh.

5003812~Beef en Croûte with Coriander Walnut Filling~179~1~0~9~14~195~4~Tenderloin roasts vary in shape, size, and weight. For this recipe it's important that the tenderloin be of uniform shape and size. If you can't find a whole tenderloin, 2 center-cut pieces will work.

5003813~Chilled Cucumber-Yogurt Soup with Radishes~450~70~23~26~0~3437~37~This pretty and refreshing soup - flavored with curry, cumin, ginger and garlic-is quick to prepare: Just put everything in the blender and puree it.

5003815~Venison Tenderloin with Madeira Green Peppercorn Sauce~779~7~3~0~78~1657~10~If venison isn't for you, beef tenderloin is a good alternative (see cooks' note, below). Because beef is not as dense and rich as venison, the portions are slightly larger (cooking times and temperatures will also be different).
5003816~Winter Salad with Lemon-Yogurt Dressing~3693~377~112~140~144~2815~30~We love using kohlrabi in salads. The light green or purple veggie looks like a cross between a turnip and a fennel bulb and tastes like celery root or a mild turnip.

The low-fat, low-calorie, and vegan broth is loaded with disease-fighting herbs and spices, including ginger, which has anti-inflammatory properties and is a digestive aid, cinnamon, which has been shown to help balance blood sugar, and garlic, which has powerful antimicrobial properties. If you are following an Ayurvedic diet, the experts at Ananda recommend this for vata and kapha doshas.
5003819~Spiced Coffee Affogato With Vanilla Ice Cream~1634~133~109~29~111~335~302~This clever pour-over dessert proves that, yes, it will affogato.
5003820~Charred Padrón Chiles and Squid Salad~853~9~1~33~78~2530~61~One in ten Padróns or shishitos is actually spicy. Pepper roulette!
5003821~French Toast with Banana-Orange Filling~633~98~51~21~13~796~46~This breakfast treat tastes decadent but is really quite low in fat. It's topped with maple-spiked yogurt.
5003822~Italian Strawberry Tart~2091~371~211~80~79~1453~562~This tart was inspired by a plum tart often cooked by the mother of Lisa's college roommate. Due to Lisa's reckless dissemination of that recipe (which caused an overpopulation of plum tarts up and down the eastern seaboard), her recipe-exchange privileges with said mother have been revoked.
5003823~Butter Pecan Shortcakes with Ice Cream and Caramelized Pineapple and Bananas~4657~645~258~82~190~3206~305~Don't save shortcakes just for strawberry season. They're also delicious served with other fruits, like this tropical combination.
5003824~Chunky Almond Oil~3093~31~6~44~327~599~0~This is one of my pantry staples; you'll find it in many of the recipes throughout this book. It makes for a super-easy sauce on its own, or you can mix it with lemon juice or vinegar to create a great dressing in less than a minute. Whenever almonds are on sale at the local store, I grab a few bags and make big batches, freezing some for future use. Each time you use this oil, make sure to grab an even proportion of oil to almonds so that you don't end up with a lopsided ratio.
5010388~Salsa Mexicana~171~22~10~1~9~892~0~This recipe is part of the Epicurious Online Cooking School, in partnership with the Culinary Institute of America. To watch it being made, and to learn how to make other Mexican classics, check out the video classes.
5003826~Blackberry Hand Pies~766~196~169~3~0~29~3~Eating one of these individual pies is quite different from your basic fork-and-plate experience. A bite through the crisp pastry, sparkling with sugar, reveals a thick filling of sweet-and-tart fruit.
5003827~Duck Liver Pâté~1486~49~7~8~128~1055~339~This may not be as good as a true foie gras, but it's similar enough in flavor for a dish that costs only pennies to make. Not only can the pâté be served on toast — it can also serve as a finish for a classic Beef Wellington or enhance a stuffing or a meat loaf.
5003828~Garlic-Roasted Striped Bass~1021~39~3~15~85~894~53~"The <epi:recipelink id=""102741"">sautéed mushrooms epi:recipelinkawould make a great side dish for this fish, along with steamed green beans or broccoli.</epi:recipelinka></epi:recipelink>"

Skipping the truffles makes it more everyday, but it's still wonderful.
5008803~Roasted Salmon with Cucumber Sour Cream~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~Offer steamed new potatoes alongside. What to drink: Chardonnay or Sancerre.
5003837~Tarragon Crab Salad~875~20~3~106~41~2118~408~The keys to this fast, simple dish, which was inspired by a crab-stuffed tomato at Yves Camdeborde's Paris brasserie, Le Comptoir du Relais, are ripe tomatoes, fresh herbs, and excellent crabmeat.
5003839~Spinach Jewish Style~1493~122~76~9~114~889~0~Spinaci all'Ebraica
5003840~Coconut Bake~2273~392~44~47~46~2482~0~In Trinidad, this rustic coconut loaf with a biscuit-like texture is traditionally eaten with bul jol, which is also known as pick-up saltfish . The bread is quick and easy to make, and is great for breakfast with tropical jams such as guava, passion fruit, or mango.
5003981~Turkey Potpie with Cheddar Biscuit Crust~3652~423~57~201~190~11702~579~This recipe could easily become a year-round favorite—simply substitute supermarket rotisserie chicken for the turkey. And as a special treat for the kids (or the kid in you), make individual-size pies, using eight 10- to 12-ounce gratin dishes.
5003842~Pickled Vegetables~1007~171~87~42~15~49546~17~Highly recommended!
5003843~Grilled Steak with Fresh Garden Herbs~538~12~8~0~55~131~0~Link likes to use herbs from his garden in this recipe.
5003844~Shrimp and Grits~174~17~5~22~4~4021~194~The combination of seafood, sausage, and grits creates a hearty and homey dish that brings the smells and tastes of the Lowcountry into your kitchen, no matter where you live.
5003846~Bacon-and-Egg Rice~2733~403~11~78~88~5676~496~We've made this colorful dish using fresh cooked rice instead of leftover takeout. There's plenty here for a hearty breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
5003847~Crispy Rice Cakes With Tarator Sauce~1594~224~3~33~56~391~71~Tarator is usually made with tahini, but the base for this recipe is almonds. It serves as both a binder for the rice cakes and as a sauce.
5018177~Pie Crust~2174~467~76~53~0~484~0~Be sure to make the dough in a stand mixer (not a processor), which will prevent you from overworking it.
5003849~Broiled Tofu with Cilantro Pesto~734~7~4~3~79~1943~0~This pan-Asian tofu gets brilliant color and lively flavor from an easy cilantro pesto. To make this dish vegetarian, you can simply replace the fish sauce with soy sauce.
5003850~Tamarind Ginger Cooler~1135~227~0~0~0~27724~0~Both ginger plants and tamarind trees grow in tropical spots around the world, including India, Asia, and Latin America, where the two seasonings are regularly used in marinades, sauces, and drinks. So it was only natural for Feniger to take some of the spicy ginger syrup she had developed for the Canton Ginger Kick and mix it with tart tamarind. The result is very fresh and very quaffable. Feniger says that when they make it at Street, they often save the tamarind pulp that's left in the sieve and add more water; that tamarind liquid will be thinner than the first batch, but it will still have enough of its signature fruity sharpness for another round.
5003851~Chocolate Chunk, Orange and Hazelnut Cookies~5210~619~257~91~259~1068~277~A mug of hot chocolate or a glass of milk would complement these updated, sophisticated chocolate chip cookies.
5003852~Ice-Tray Sushi Blocks~2256~400~14~66~47~1766~146~Like most foods they can pick up and dip, this gentle introduction to sushi, which takes only 30 minutes to prepare, is a hit with kids. Serve with low-sodium soy sauce (or whatever dip will get your child excited about eating).
5003853~Smoked Salmon with Horseradish Cream~1427~12~0~69~130~1816~522~Whatever else you set out, great smoked salmon will always draw a crowd. And like any good leading actor, it works well with all of the supporting players, from horseradish cream to egg salad.
5008617~Fried Avocado Tacos (Tacos de aguacate rebosado)~370~118~20~43~0~973~0~Frying avocadoes may seem as strange to you as they did to me until I tasted them at Puntarena in Mexico City. They are a delight, so give them a try!
5003855~Spicy Honey Mustard Sauce~1346~103~90~0~84~7450~126~A pinch of cayenne and two kinds of mustard give this sweet and savory condiment a kick.
5003856~Butterscotch Pie with Curry Crust~5632~494~358~161~343~3575~821~Curry crust? Trust us: This lightly spiced crumb will win Best in Show. If you want to take it even further, add a teaspoon of toasted crushed cumin seeds, too.
5003857~Creamed Parsley~1190~137~97~5~52~530~172~In this unusual side dish from Spring restaurant, often under appreciated parsley gets the creamed-spinach treatment—and a little help from aromatic orange zest, mint, and fresh ginger.

5003860~Beef Liver Bourguignonne~2259~106~13~36~181~3211~450~Highly recommended!
5003861~Cumin-and-Paprika-Spiced Marcona Almonds~4403~115~22~169~389~5274~4~Almonds were brought to Spain by the Moors, and they've featured in Andalusian cuisine ever since. Typically they are used as a thickener for sauces and, most famously, as the base of ajo blanco. Whole Marcona almonds are roasted with sweet or hot smoked paprika–I prefer to use sweet paprika, introduce a little heat via cayenne, and round it out with cumin and salt. In the event of a crippling Marcona almond shortage, regular blanched almonds will do the trick.
5003862~Roasted Potatoes with Garlic~1015~192~6~18~20~0~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5003863~Spicy Southern Barbeque Sauce~361~62~50~1~16~889~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5003868~Rib-Eye Steaks with Bell Pepper and Olives~802~58~3~10~22~643~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5003869~Leek and Mushroom Gratin~3531~402~70~115~147~3519~420~This gratin, which is delicious with roast chicken or pork chops, employs a favorite technique: cooking vegetables covered with a round of parchment paper placed directly on them, rather than with a lid. This low-tech method allows just enough steam to escape while keeping the vegetables—leeks, in this case—perfectly moist. A bit of lemon zest helps balance the gratin's richness.
5003870~Lemon-Mustard Vinaigrette~203~38~5~0~0~356~0~Highly recommended!

5003876~Kumquat and Cranberry Compote~1271~328~328~0~0~717~0~If you can't find kumquats, don't panic — the recipe works fine without them.
5007643~Basic Flaky Pie Crust~3272~0~0~0~358~1585~980~This pie crust is light, flaky tender and very crisp. It has a glorious butter flavor and is an ideal container for any pie or tart recipe. I strongly recommend commercial or homemade pastry flour, as it will result in a more tender crust than one made with all-purpose flour.
5005074~Tomato, Onion, and Serrano Chile Salsa~107~26~17~4~0~2023~0~Salsa Mexicana
5003879~Herby Corn Salad~549~13~6~0~55~20~0~"""Cool and bright, this herb-laced corn salad is my new summer staple."" —Alfia Muzio, recipe developer"
5003880~Peach and Blackberry Shortcakes with Blackberry Cream~3381~512~493~6~141~2366~569~"Shortcakes are biscuit-like cakes that have more butter (or shortening) than many other types of cake. In fact, pastry chefs often describe especially buttery doughs as ""short."""
5003881~Lemon Cakes with Basil Lemon Syrup~2867~312~311~12~186~828~898~Highly recommended!
5003882~Pork Tenderloin with Maple Glaze~867~124~118~17~31~902~85~Maple syrup brings sweetness and warm color to the pork. Wild rice pilaf, brussels sprouts and a Gewürztraminer would be nice accompaniments.
5003883~White Radish Boats with Tapenade~1324~143~46~35~59~1757~431~Highly recommended!
5003884~Grilled Herb Potatoes~3663~711~137~67~46~20975~0~The humble potato, given a little something extra, always elicits oohs and aahs. This is especially true when it's tossed with an herb-infused oil and cooked on the grill.
5003885~Welsh Rabbit~889~35~22~28~68~3165~160~This classic combination of melted cheese and toasted bread is also called Welsh rarebit — an attempt to dignify the original (and slightly silly) name. For best visual appeal, use an aged yellow Cheddar for the sauce.
5003886~Spiced Pumpkin Seed and Cashew Crunch~1136~34~9~52~87~2039~4~For a salty, savory, crunchy boost, sprinkle this on roasted vegetables, soups, and hot cereal.
5003887~Pan-Seared Sea Scallops with Lentils, Bacon, and Cider Reduction~5690~789~480~135~199~5082~486~Lentilles du Puy are lighter than other lentils and hold their shape especially well during cooking.
5003888~Espresso-Hazelnut Cheesecake~7446~594~403~87~522~3023~1436~Highly recommended!
5003889~Peppermint Cream-Puff Ring with Chocolate Glaze~2479~433~210~51~55~992~414~The delicate, refreshing flavor of fresh mint leaves infuses the cream used to make the peppermint filling. You'll need a stand mixer to make the pastry.
5003890~Crispy Fish with Sweet-and-Sour Sauce~11055~365~126~101~1061~2955~222~Highly recommended!

5003892~Celery Root Rémoulade and Pan-Seared Sea Scallops~1966~138~6~94~111~4183~266~Highly recommended!
5003893~Black Cod with Olives and Potatoes in Parchment~2132~214~36~16~131~11072~0~A favorite Barese recipe (often named for San Nicola, the guardian saint of sailors), these little packets seal in the fish and vegetable juices, with the potato slices insulating the fish from the heat of the oven and the olives and lemon slices emphasizing its bright flavors.
5003894~Asparagus and Mushroom Salad with Shaved Parmesan~248~48~20~14~0~2109~0~Although raw asparagus might seem unusual to those who have only eaten asparagus cooked, it is delicious. The slightly different flavor is highlighted in the following salad.
5003895~Cappuccino Brownies with White Chocolate-Espresso Sauce~6352~804~571~74~333~958~846~Highly recommended!

5013814~Quince Apple Strudels with Quince Syrup~6384~982~460~121~236~2512~432~Served with small scoops of ice cream and a pink-hued syrup, this fruit-filled dessert delivers a glorious finale to a special dinner. Strudel dough looks more difficult to make than it really is. The secret is using bread flour, a high-gluten flour, which allows you to stretch a small amount of dough over a large surface.
5012673~Star-Fruit Chips~1774~473~473~0~0~0~0~Wonderfully festive and fun, these candied star-shaped chips — a favorite among children — have a slight tropical flavor that makes them a sunny treat with or without the strudel.

5003906~Chicken Pot Roast~950~71~38~21~68~2409~125~This dish is sumptuous but a snap to make. Once you've browned the chicken, simply pop it into the oven and baste it occasionally. Serve it over buttered noodles to soak up all the luscious juices.
5003907~Roasted Sea Bass Provençale~217~17~8~2~4~1997~0~Sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, capers and thyme add Mediterranean flavor to the fish.

5003925~Polenta Budino With Plum Marmellata~2769~412~371~29~118~1517~415~Budino is what Italians ask for when they want pudding. Sub in any stone fruit for the plums.
5005756~Cooked Raspberry Sauce~546~133~119~2~1~3~0~Here's a good base recipe for using frozen berries to prepare a flavorful sauce. I find that frozen berries need to cook a little to make them less watery and to concentrate their flavor. Look for raspberries that come frozen in a bag. Feel the bag to make sure all of the individual berries are loose and not clumped together. Bags of frozen berries tend to taste better than those frozen in a block.
5014362~Red Chile Salsa~375~57~23~0~13~0~0~Highly recommended!
5003928~Classic Chocolate Mousse~1663~149~125~29~114~784~276~Dark chocolate and espresso add the slightly bitter notes needed to balance this dessert. Remember, the higher the cacao percentage, the less sweet the chocolate.

5003936~Mushroom Wraps with Spinach, Bell Peppers and Goat Cheese~4029~509~31~181~143~8752~251~"At the end of the century, vegetarian cooking gained wide acceptance-and became sophisticated. Wraps (basically burritos) were a hot fast food; everything from Thai chicken to ahi tuna got ""wrapped"" in flour tortillas or flatbread. The two trends pair up in this terrific dish. To make these even more like burritos, add one 15- to 16-ounce can of drained black beans to the filling."
5003937~Rock Shrimp Pasta With Spicy Tomato Sauce~1683~276~46~48~32~2886~86~A flavorful tomato sauce that’s a cinch to make and rock shrimp that come already peeled mean a weeknight dinner recipe has never been so easy—or delicious.
5019416~Sesame Miso Vinaigrette~418~16~10~2~36~1248~0~Like the best dressings, this is good on so much more than greens: Drizzle it on roasted sweet potatoes, brush it onto broiled eggplant, or toss it with cold soba or udon noodles. Use it to marinate mushrooms before grilling them to make Juicy Bella . Look for miso paste in the refrigerated section of natural food stores and Asian markets. If you can find South River brand, made in Massachusetts, snap it up; it's the best I've tasted outside Japan.

5015492~Broiled Duck Breasts with Orange Chipotle Sauce~1408~305~275~24~13~5147~107~Duck breast is a sadly underrated meat. Served rare to medium-rare and sliced on the diagonal, it has the mineral tang of beef. This southwestern version, with its slightly spicy sauce, elicits every ounce of flavor from the bird. And it's so easy!
5003944~Chicken, Broccoli and Fusilli in Garlic Cream Sauce~3723~324~31~136~174~5074~477~Highly recommended!

5003949~Minted Cucumber Raita~367~53~22~17~6~806~34~Serve this Indian condiment with grilled chicken, curries or sliced tomatoes.
5003950~Pineapple, Arugula, Macadamia Nut~1456~274~194~17~31~108~0~"Trust us, this combination is super-clean and green, refreshing and yummy. The alkalinizing fresh pineapple pairs beautifully with the spice of the arugula/rocket. And macadamia nuts are a high-energy food that adds a crunchy rich texture and a healthy dose of protein and fiber (we don't mind at all if they do not fully incorporate) as well as monounsaturated fatty acids—or ""good"" fat—that significantly reduce blood serum cholesterol levels. Think of this smoothie as a cleansing, satisfying meal replacement. Get to know chia seeds. These miraculous little seeds are a form of easily digestible protein that is full of minerals, vitamins, and soluble fiber. Rich in omega fatty acids, and similar to flaxseed, chia seeds have the significant advantage of being more stable."
5003951~Creamy Rice Pudding with Tropical Fruits~3684~484~208~24~190~2696~314~If rice pudding is getting a little too comfortable, try our version with fresh pineapple, mango, and papaya.

5014135~Cauliflower Cheddar Gratin with Horseradish Crumbs~1372~70~50~27~109~3346~289~We think of this gratin as a vegetable-driven version of everyone's favorite, mac and cheese. The nutty, sweet undertones of cauliflower are particularly suited to meld with the tangy, salty Cheddar and the spicy horseradish.
5003965~Clay Pot Chicken with Dates, Sucuk and Bulgur~2095~277~184~26~79~2182~496~In Turkish cookery there's a distinctive group of dishes known as güveç, which take their name from the earthenware pot in which they are cooked—in the same way that the tagine does in Morocco. In rural Anatolia the cooking pots may be sealed and buried in the ashes of a fire to cook slowly overnight—or, only slightly less romantically, in the local baker's oven. If you don't have a clay pot, a heavy-based cast-iron casserole dish will serve almost as well.
5003966~Panfried Tofu on Sesame Watercress with Soy-Orange Dressing~969~77~28~32~52~1671~0~This recipe is a wonderful way to prepare tofu as a main course; all it needs is a side of rice.

5019287~Gnocchi~1378~275~14~135~29~4998~75~Highly recommended!
5003982~Homemade Ranch Dressing~1918~41~29~28~130~2633~126~Texas cowboys and cowgirls dip their egg sandwiches in this stuff for breakfast, they dunk their fried onion rings in it at lunch, and they cover their broccoli with it at dinner. It's the ultimate dipping sauce for cold pizza, the perfect accompaniment to crudités, and—oh, yeah—it's also a salad dressing. Once you learn how to make your own ranch dressing, you'll save yourself a fortune on the stuff. And it's really easy. You can even use yogurt instead of sour cream to make a low-fat version. Add some minced herbs from your garden if you like. Chives are another great addition.

5003996~Feta, Spinach, and Basil Omelette Muffins~1108~57~15~44~76~3720~453~"I like to make things in my cupcake tray that are not cupcakes. Often. And these quasi-muffin
omelettes are one of my favorite. A good thing to do is to make a whole load and store them in the
fridge for lunches, brunches, and snacks for the family to enjoy without having to make them fresh each time. They will keep for a couple of days in the fridge."
5003997~Chicken Long Rice~750~47~30~53~44~28640~172~Despite its name, this dish is not rice at all but noodles—and not even rice noodles but shimmering, transparent bean threads with lots of chicken flavor. Got that straight?

5004005~Tomato Toast with Peaches, Mozzarella, and Mint~828~30~24~39~64~872~169~In love with Caprese salad? Then you'll definitely want to try this new take on the classic, which gets a dose of sweetness from ripe peaches.

5004008~Bucatini with Sausage and Peppers~3353~502~43~147~86~5777~163~This recipe is a prime example of how to cut calories without sacrificing flavor. We use a ton of vegetables and just a handful of flavorful sausage. Don't skimp on the time needed to wilt down the vegetables, because that time adds sweetness to the sauce.
5004009~Potato, Green Bean, and Corn Salad~6627~1394~306~136~34~41083~0~Highly recommended!
5004010~Manchego Cheese and Garlic Dogs~565~39~4~14~37~561~59~A roasted garlic and red pepper relish replaces the usual pickle in this Spanish take on hot dogs.

5006712~Cremini Meringue Mushrooms~1234~245~216~19~27~366~21~Mushrooms made from meringue are the traditional edible decoration for a Yule log cake, and their cute quotient is high—they never fail to charm young and old alike. Saying they're edible is like calling a chocolate truffle edible; if you love crisp meringue, you'll adore the crunchy, airy contrast the mushrooms provide for our creamy Tiramisu Yule Log cake. Classically they're made from a white meringue, but we couldn't resist coloring ours with a little added cocoa to make the mushrooms look like cremini or baby bellas.
5004017~Tomato, Cucumber and Guacamole Sandwiches~790~160~43~22~19~2635~0~These easy-to-make meatless sandwiches are nice for a picnic. Wrap them in plastic, and transport them in a cooler.

Savage of Framingham, Massachusetts. ""My favorite meal of the trip was at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills. I had an Indian-style chicken salad that was wonderfully spicy and flavorful.

Be sure to remind guests to squeeze a grilled orange wedge over the chicken just before eating.
5004029~Shrimp and Pea Risotto~787~43~15~31~39~4698~288~If you can get fresh shelled peas, cook them in a pan of boiling water until they are just tender, 3 to 5 minutes, then drain and toss them with the chives, zest, and pepper.

5004036~Mustard Aioli-Grilled Potatoes with Fines Herbes~4936~881~168~84~104~26538~126~An abundance of mustard seeds grows in California's Napa Valley—as it does in the south of France; the regions share a similar climate. It makes sense, then, that many of the same ingredients feature prominently in both cuisines. These potatoes, grilled with a mustardy aioli (basically, garlic-scented mayonnaise) and served with a scattering of herbs, would be at home on either region's table. Delicate parsley, chives, and tarragon are known collectively as fines herbes and are a staple of Mediterranean cooking.
5004037~Tomatoes Stuffed with Fresh Mozzarella and Basil~998~6~6~0~110~371~0~A basil vinaigrette is served in a shot glass alongside each tomato; guests can drizzle it on to taste.

5004042~Horseradish Dunk~206~200~52~10~59~2617~2~Every Passover, my maternal grandfather, Irving, made beet horseradish from scratch. He was a gardener with a true green thumb when it came to tomatoes, but I can't remember if he grew his own horseradish. What I do remember is how teary-eyed everyone got when he served my grandmother's homemade gefilte fish with his beet horseradish on the side. Through the sniffles, we all expressed delight and assured him that this batch was the hottest and best yet. Horseradish is one of those flavors I have always loved. For all you other horseradish lovers out there, here's a fabulous dip. Use extra-hot prepared horseradish to guarantee those sniffles and teary eyes.
5004043~Waldorf Salad with Cranberries and Pecans in Radicchio Cups~4707~445~326~42~333~3653~253~This updated classic adds dashes of red — and depth of flavor — to the usual apple, celery, and walnut mix. Make the salad ahead and refrigerate, then add the watercress and pecans right before serving.

5004046~Cucumber, Buffalo Mozzarella, and Farro Salad~753~17~9~67~53~1780~139~Food editor Maggie Ruggiero was humming for weeks after enjoying a salad of fresh buffalo mozzarella, cucumber, and the Italian wheat called farro at the Manhattan restaurant Il Buco. She set about reimagining it, and her versions accents—tender lettuce, basil, and a light, lemony dressing—beautifully complement the cheese. Since fresh mozzarella is the star here, it's essential to use the best you can find. We love the kind traditionally made in Italy from the milk of water buffalo for its custardlike texture and sweet, milky tang. Recently, some American producers have gotten in on the act as well.
5004047~Beer Can Chicken~475~61~55~15~15~2932~62~This odd recipe makes some of the most moist, succulent, flavorful barbecued chicken I've ever tasted. The secret: an open can of beer is inserted into the cavity of the bird, which is cooked upright on the grill. Besides being incredibly tender, the bird makes a great conversation piece. The recipe was inspired by the Bryce Boar Blazers, a barbecue team from Texas I met at the Memphis in May World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest. The proper beverage? Beer, of course.
5005201~Rosemary-Roasted Turkey with Gravy~1081~47~6~0~95~430200~253~Chef Rathbun's method of roasting a turkey involves brushing the skin and packing the cavity with butter, then starting the roasting at a relatively high temperature — 450°F. As the turkey browns, the butter and turkey fat melt and pool under the grate, eliminating the need to add water to the pan juices. After 40 minutes, the oven is turned down to 350°F and the buttery drippings are used as a basting liquid. This technique seals in the bird's natural juices, producing crisp, golden skin and moist meat.
5004049~Frozen Plum Souffles with Cardamom-Plum Sauce~4742~935~612~37~112~195~412~Use the ripest purple-fleshed plums available to intensify the flavor of this pretty summertime treat.
5004050~Sour Cream and Herb Muffins~3300~417~44~89~54~4518~370~Try these alongside egg dishes at brunch or with soup and salad for lunch.
5004051~Roasted Portobello and Prosciutto Lasagna~5175~157~102~289~358~14172~1178~Get the most out of every ingredient by layering flavors. Roasting portobello mushrooms before adding them to the lasagna lends a meaty smokiness.
5004052~Honey Almond Granola~6189~779~175~153~290~826~0~Theres nothing quite like making your own granola. You can toss in as many nuts and fruits as you want and sweeten it to your taste. While the possibilities are endless, we love this honey-sweetened variation with sesame seeds. The cardamom clings to the almonds, dried apricots and pears, and oats, adding an exotic touch.
5012005~Red Wine Sauce~2341~43~23~136~176~11283~547~Serve with mustard-seed-crusted pork medallions.
5004054~Blackberry Buttermilk Panna Cottas with Blackberry Compote~1538~79~45~13~141~137~471~If you're using reactive metal molds for your panna cottas, make sure there are no rust spots — the acid in the buttermilk and the fruit will react to the exposed rust and cause the panna cotta to discolor. We had the best luck with molds made of nonreactive materials such as stainless steel, glass, and ceramic.

5004056~Pineapple-Mint Mojito~3647~872~416~31~7~6624~0~Pineapple adds sweetness and a tropical twist to this classic cocktail. Make sure to choose a ripe one: It should be very fragrant, with no soft spots or bruises. Or use fresh precut pineapple.
5004057~Swiss Chard, Raisin, and Pine Nut Tart~1160~165~128~31~47~1906~161~The flavors of this tart are remarkably balanced—it's a bit savory and a bit sweet. (In fact, in the south of France, where it's known as tourte aux blettes, you'll often see the pastry served for dessert.) Paired with a simple salad, it makes for a supremely satisfying light dinner.
5004058~Ginger Cranberry Sauce~3953~996~912~5~0~401~0~Cranberries add sparkle to the meal.
5004059~Asparagus Goat Cheese Bruschetta with Porcini Vinaigrette~1785~81~21~48~143~2180~159~Dried porcini give this vinaigrette a huge boost of flavor and marry beautifully with the asparagus and goat cheese for a spring-like first course. Serve this dish with sharp knives (like steak knives) so the toast and asparagus cut easily.

5004074~Mediterranean Tuna and Radish Salad~949~93~41~22~57~2189~10~Imported or domestic tuna packed in olive oil is a staple in my pantry. I make quick tomato sauces with it, use it on sandwiches, and especially in salads. This is a great main-dish salad, with tender tuna and crunchy, spicy radishes.

5004080~Grilled Eggplant with Lebneh~1213~39~0~3~116~2638~0~If you're using whole-milk plain yogurt instead of lebneh, you'll have to allow extra time (at least 8 hours) for draining.

5004091~Watercress, Pear and Walnut Salad with Poppy Seed Dressing~1996~106~70~2~177~525~0~The Pennsylvania Dutch settled in the places where they found the most black walnut trees. Toasted walnuts add crunch and flavor to this terrific salad.

5004106~Lemony Yogurt Sauce~16~0~0~0~1~39~0~This bright, creamy yogurt sauce is lightly flecked with herbs and is great for everything from drizzling over savory bowls of grains to spooning on top of fried rice, breakfast hash, or Buckwheat Crepes. Double the recipe for a larger group or to keep a little jar of the sauce in the refrigerator. It's season-less, really.
5004107~Beef and Bacon Meatloaf~1881~193~62~82~77~7762~509~Highly recommended!

5004111~Roasted Butternut Squash with Balsamic Vinegar~320~80~16~8~0~0~0~If you've never thought of roasted squash as a side dish, try this recipe. Just rub pieces of butternut squash with olive oil, salt and pepper and bake until their flesh is tender and roasted to tawny gold. Serve the squash the way it's eaten in country houses in the part of the Emilia-Romagna region where nearly every family makes its own balsamic vinegar. Small bottles of balsamico are set out on the table, and everyone seasons their squash to taste with the vinegar. Try the squash with grilled lamb chops, roast chicken, pork and simple sautéed fish dishes.
5015078~Beurre Blanc~772~3~1~0~78~863~214~One taste of this smooth, supple butter sauce, and you'll understand why it's a French classic.
5005024~Black Pepper-Crusted Standing Rib Roast au Jus~3013~127~49~96~228~36775~588~Boning the roast makes slicing the meat much easier at serving time: Have your butcher remove the backbone, or chine, from the whole rack and cut the meat off the ribs in one piece, then tie the meat back onto the bones. The roast can be served on or off the bones. To crack whole peppercorns, enclose them in a resealable plastic bag and crush slightly with a meat mallet. What to drink: A medium- to full-bodied red with peppery spice, such as Syrah (called Shiraz if it's from Australia).

You can customize the size of the zest by using a Microplane for smaller pieces or a 5-hole zester for longer strips.

5004135~Grilled Butterflied Leg of Lamb with Tomato-Fennel Vinaigrette~1431~94~45~15~73~4543~47~Why you'll make it: Because it's that dinner-party dish that's as do-able as it is drop-dead gorgeous. Call your meat market ahead to order a boned, butterflied leg of lamb, and ask that the thickness be as even as possible (two to three inches thick). Start the lamb the day before; it needs to be refrigerated overnight covered with the rub.
5004136~Ham and Swiss Puff-Pastry Quiche~2914~96~15~199~214~6169~876~Classic taste, new look. The borders puff up beautifully to keep the filling in place.
5004137~Farmhouse Butternut Squash Soup~1386~175~40~45~54~4262~115~Green apple and a dash of cider vinegar provide just the right amount of tart balance in this slightly sweet, down-home soup topped with homemade bacon bits.

5004150~Irish Pub Salad~1465~44~11~49~131~1882~608~Tangy Irish cheddar or Cashel, an Irish blue cheese, is ideal for this typical main-course pub salad; you can substitute English cheddar or French Roquefort. Thick slices of buttered soda bread and some raisin tarts could round out the menu.

5004156~Peanut Dacquoise with Peanut Butter Mousse~3731~367~320~49~258~369~794~Dacquoise sounds very fancy, but it's just a dessert made of giant flat meringues layered with mousse, whipped cream, or buttercream.
5004157~Plantain Picadillo Pie with Cheese~2526~65~14~119~162~1959~388~A layer of sliced fried plantains forms the crust; picadillo — a Latin dish of ground meat, tomatoes, and spices — makes a savory filling. This would be a lovely supper with bread and a salad.
5004158~Eggplant Kuku~536~37~4~12~33~2080~433~Persian in origin, this soufflé is wonderfully airy, and the eggplant is infused with garlic and lemon. Think of it as a warm, puffy baba ghanouj.
5004159~Rib Eye With Bone Marrow and Radish Salad~1088~63~41~34~94~1194~172~Make sure the butcher cuts the marrow bone in half for you.

5004161~Japanese Beef Stew~2300~162~78~175~85~17471~449~Trimming all corners and ragged edges from the carrots and potatoes is very Japanese; rounded edges also ensure even cooking. In Japan we used metal molds to cut our carrots into plum blossoms for a seasonal motif.

5004165~Kale, Tomato, and Lemon Magic One-Pot Spaghetti~2331~330~15~30~103~3242~0~This pasta is a complete revelation. The sauce is magically made from the pasta water and tomatoes as the pasta cooks—all in one pan. No fuss, one pan, and a killer bowl of pasta. Pasta and gluten sometimes get bad press. I think there is a time and place for a good bowl of pasta. Saying that, I opt for interesting pastas as often as I do the traditional kind. Try corn, chickpea, or buckwheat spaghetti—they are gluten-free, and all have incredible individual flavors and make a welcome change if pasta is a staple in your house. The key to this recipe is to measure your water carefully and to use the right pan: you need a large, shallow sauté pan or casserole large enough to fit the pasta lying down. A large, deep frying pan or wok would work well too.
5004166~Gimlet~256~57~51~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!

5004170~Potlikker Noodles with Mustard Greens~2720~333~56~99~106~8142~538~Just as Italians save their pasta cooking water to enrich their sauces, Southerners serve the smoky cooking liquid, a.k.a. potlikker, along with braised greens. This dish marries both traditions. Season with a light hand, as the broth will become saltier as it reduces.
5004171~Romaine with Parmesan Dressing~321~16~5~14~21~218~26~Highly recommended!

5004180~Braised Cauliflower with Curry and Yogurt~293~20~10~3~23~1099~2~Sautéing the cauliflower before braising intensifies its naturally mild, sweet flavor. Yogurt is the braising medium here. It mellows the flavors of the curry and makes the cauliflower especially rich-tasting.
5004181~Maple-Glazed Yams with Pecan Topping~2892~387~193~29~146~1744~253~Highly recommended!
5004182~Country-Style Pork Ribs With Bourbon and Coke BBQ Sauce~972~159~102~10~20~4522~26~"Country-style ribs are not actually ribs. This cut of meat comes from the shoulder of the pig, where it is sliced in
half under the blade bone and then cut into long strips to resemble ribs. As a result, much like other tough cuts of
meat, country-style ribs benefit from any type of low and slow cooking. Tender, tangy, and accented with just a hint
of bourbon, these ribs are a messy, saucy affair. Bone-in country-style ribs are recommended for this recipe since it’s
the bones that are packed with the most flavor (you can use boneless ribs, but they may require less cooking time)."
5004183~Shrimp and Veggie Stir-Fry~4581~836~35~213~34~7001~880~Highly recommended!
5004184~Cod with Mussels, Chorizo, Fried Croutons, and Saffron Mayonnaise~3248~141~28~160~201~6109~937~The cod is topped with housemade mayonnaise at Hugo's. We offer a simplified version.
5004270~Apple Fritters with Orange Glaze~8759~589~379~104~758~3456~485~Hanukkah is the celebration of ritual oil that miraculously lasted for eight days instead of one, which is why oil factors prominently during the holiday. While latkes (potato pancakes pan-fried in oil) are traditional—and we've never met a latke we didn't love—why not end the meal this year with apple fritters that are as tender and delicate as cake doughnuts? Drizzled with an orange glaze, they echo the flavors of the winter season.
5020106~Parmesan Puffs~12218~1~0~9~1419~195~4~Highly recommended!
5004187~Yangzhou Fried Rice~1792~223~14~77~59~4839~580~This simple, delicious dish hails from China's Shanghai region. It's a great way to use up leftover rice—if your rice is already cooked, you'll need 3 cups of it.
5004188~Bruschetta with Rosemary, Roasted Plum Tomatoes, Ricotta and Prosciutto~743~56~16~47~30~3907~174~Roasting the tomatoes concentrates their flavor.

5004190~Grilled Sirloin Steaks with Blue Cheese-Walnut Butter~1794~46~2~64~143~5623~351~Robust flavors of blue cheese and walnuts go a long way in this flavored butter. (Any leftover butter is good on baked potatoes, or spread it on baguette rounds.)
5004191~Pasta Shells with Summer Vegetable Sauce~1041~72~10~10~80~2986~0~Highly recommended!
5004192~Chicken Breasts with Wild Mushrooms, Marjoram, and Marsala~1284~68~17~23~89~2552~265~Highly recommended!
5004193~Shrimp Tikka with Fresh Mango Chutney~1820~85~17~194~72~2140~1761~Shrimp get a wake-up call from a bold spice paste that really packs a punch. A brief 30-minute swim in the marinade imbues the shrimp with intense flavor—jalapeño, ginger, and garlic lend heat, while garam masala contributes depth. Sparkle comes from a splash of lime juice. Think of the mango chutney as a fresh Indian salsa; it's crunchy, colorful, tart, and very refreshing.
5004194~Banana Bread with Chocolate Chips and Walnuts~6106~783~406~90~303~3018~718~Highly recommended!

5004197~The Crunchiest Vegetable Salad~1080~118~22~36~49~2945~10~A bowl of ice water stops the blanched vegetables from cooking and ensures they stay tender-crisp. The salt in the ice water seasons the veggies, all the while chilling them even further.
5004198~Parmesan Breads with Tomato and Onions~912~61~14~54~51~2241~118~These easy-to-make flatbreads are a terrific treat for picnics and tailgate parties.
5004199~Spanish Trail Mix~2918~79~18~106~259~1451~0~Smoked paprika, Spanish chorizo, and Manchego cheese give this a Latin kick. Eat it as a snack or serve with cocktails.

5004202~Pear Maple Johnnycake~2304~357~109~72~93~3017~605~Looking for a fast weeknight dessert? Johnnycake—essentially a cross between a pancake and corn bread—isn't fancy, but it's delicious when made with delicate pears and maple syrup.
5017582~Tomato Sauce~2059~33~0~0~220~3877~0~Escoffier codified the mother sauces of French cooking. In the Italian-American tradition, there is only one: tomato sauce. Call it marinara (we do), call it gravy (we don't), call it whatever your grandma called it. It's tomato sauce. There's almost nothing we won't cook in it or put it on.
5004204~Three-Cheese Fondue with Tomato Onion Chutney~2310~59~1~128~144~3199~2245~Highly recommended!
5017735~Cajun-Spiced Turkey~681~24~7~10~59~2007~34~Plan at least one day ahead to let the turkey—seasoned with the homemade Cajun Spice Mix—cure overnight.
5016945~Citrus-Sage Roast Turkey with Gravy: Large Crowd~1629~54~11~16~157~40~428~Sage is to turkey what cinnamon is to apples; they go together like bread and butter. The seasoned butter on this bird is a bright and herbal mix of chopped sage leaves and fresh orange and lemon zest, which bathes the breast with the essence of the Thanksgiving aroma.
5004208~Sea Breeze II~39~9~6~0~0~7~0~Highly recommended!
5004209~Sonoran Hot Dogs With Bacon, Pico de Gallo, and Avocado~1745~146~23~54~98~7488~176~This Mexican favorite may seem over the top, but the ingredients combine to make a surprisingly addictive dog. The bacon adds smoky flavor, the mayo and pinto beans bring richness, and the salsa and pickled jalapeños provide a tangy, refreshing bite.

5004223~Farfalle with Butternut Squash, Mushrooms and Spinach~2896~514~42~75~63~1308~0~"""To celebrate my birthday, my husband took me to Assaggio, one of my favorite restaurants here,"" writes Christy Wall of Portland, Oregon. ""As I always do, I ordered the bow-tie pasta with wild mushrooms, butternut squash, spinach, garlic and olive oil."""
5004224~Chicken With Kale and Freekeh-Lentil Pilaf~3854~428~36~263~153~4079~364~You'll only need 1/4 cup of the vinaigrette for the pilaf; use the rest all week.
5004225~Cranberry Sauce with Dried Cherries and Red Onion Jam~1909~423~370~4~23~294~63~Highly recommended!

5019256~Chocolate-Strawberry Ganache~4049~354~293~30~278~908~719~This recipe was created to accompany Chocolate Strawberry Orange Wedding Cake .
5004230~Wild Rice Stuffing with Wild Mushrooms~3247~547~154~37~94~6327~253~Dried pears lend a subtle sweetness to the deep, earthy taste of this stuffing.
5004231~Fig-Braised Chicken with Spiced Walnuts~2389~209~167~47~151~2900~93~When we lived in San Diego, we used to walk through dozens of neighborhoods where we found fig, pomegranate, and citrus trees everywhere. Nothing beats the delicate flavor and juicy texture of a fresh, ripe fig-nothing except for maybe the dish. While fresh figs aren't highly accessible for most people, dried figs can usually be found at just about any market. We use dried figs here to create a dish that reminds us of those summer evening walks when we would score a bounty of fresh figs. Served with spicy toasted walnuts and smothered in a sweet and silky sauce, this dish is sure to become a family favorite.
5004232~Parmesan Chicken Cutlets~3449~343~18~128~191~3501~480~If you cut the chicken into smaller pieces before breading, they're nuggets—the guilt-free kind.
5004233~Roasted Potatoes, Shallots, and Kale with Caramelized Garlic Dressing~2155~421~82~41~22~10231~0~Roasted garlic produces a rich dressing using very little oil.

5004235~Clementines in Ginger Syrup~1047~258~247~1~0~4~0~Like cinnamon in this country, cardamom plays a starring role in Algerian sweets. Paired with star anise in a gingery syrup, it gives clementine slices an irresistible aroma, but the syrup would be just as wonderful over any kind of sliced fruit.
5004236~Garlic Rosemary-Marinated Lamb Chops~132~0~0~0~14~24758~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5004241~Grapefruit with Chile and Rosemary~81~19~18~0~0~0~0~My elementary school grapefruit, all grown up. I like the low notes of the dried chiles and rosemary against the sweet-tart citrus.

5004249~Frozen Lemon Cream Meringue Cake~3940~473~454~36~230~865~728~Highly recommended!
5004250~Classic Posole~808~54~14~5~61~4514~0~Hominy, or hulled corn kernels, is the backbone of this Mexican soup (pronounced poh-SOH-lay), which can easily be made vegetarian by using vegetable stock and omitting the pork. Either way, it's best garnished with lots of cilantro, cheese, and lime and served with warm flour tortillas.
5004251~Pasta and Cauliflower Soup Federica~1975~150~26~43~132~10891~86~Romanesco cauliflower — with its cone-shaped florets — has a more subtle, nuanced flavor than traditional varieties. The size of Romanesco cauliflower can vary widely, so we call for weight in this recipe rather than number of heads.
5015854~Roasted Monkfish with Fennel-Saffron Compote~493~4~0~0~55~0~0~Team the fish with steamed rice and sautéed spinach, and pour a Sauvignon Blanc.
5004253~Gingered Lemon Almond Squares~1436~252~241~25~42~589~370~Highly recommended!
5004254~English Pea Hummus~1216~93~45~25~82~1~0~Though the healthful and now mainstream Middle Eastern dip we know as hummus typically includes chickpeas and sesame tahini, this adaptation contains neither. Rather, its similarly smooth texture comes from the natural starch and protein of the English pea. In the summer, I make a variation of this using blanched field peas of any variety, and I substitute thyme for the spring herbs and fresh garlic in place of the early green garlic of spring.
5004255~Pepper-Crusted Steak with Horseradish Cream on Grilled Garlic Crostini~1710~33~0~202~73~4403~363~I purposefully made this beef marinade super powerful. With this hors d'oeuvre, you only end up with a little mouthful and the peppery flavor needs to come through loud and clear. In the catering company, we shave the beef into small pieces which are then piled onto the crostini, so you can easily bite through without too much effort.
5004256~Root Vegetable Tarte Tatin~1600~183~45~36~81~5131~79~We love the color and texture you get from using a combination, but any single root vegetable can be used here, too.
5004257~Tamarind-Glazed Black Cod with Habanero-Orange Salsa~849~144~100~1~27~1482~0~If black cod isn't available, a firm white fish, such as halibut or barramundi, would also work well.
5004258~Chocolate-Nut Tart with Dried Fruit~3991~416~235~57~242~5304~378~Chop your favorite nuts and dried fruit to fill this tart. If desired, use toasted coconut or chopped crystallized ginger instead of toffee bits for the garnish.
5004259~Chipotle Cheese Fondue~2633~121~42~142~156~2516~2252~Highly recommended!
5004260~Whiskey Flip~175~21~20~9~3~241~17~Flips were originally hot drinks made with egg and a variety of liquors and wines. They were warmed up by means of a loggerhead, an iron tool with a long handle and bulbous end that could be heated and plunged, like a poker, into the drink. Today, however, flips are generally served cold. Historically, they have been most often served in the morning or at bedtime, because of their soothing character.
5004261~Mussels with Roasted Potatoes~1852~50~0~130~103~6538~426~Highly recommended!

5004264~Raspberry Mint Vinegar~2015~499~359~4~0~0~0~Flavored vinegars can be used to enliven dressings and marinades, finish pan sauces, or pickle vegetables--and they make wonderful gifts. Once the steeping is completed, these vinegars keep for several months. (Garnishes and other solids left in the jar, however, may discolor or break down.)
5004265~Mahogany Beef Stew with Red Wine and Hoisin Sauce~3372~177~129~350~139~3437~1048~Hoisin adds complexity to the flavor of the sauce. You can save some time — and some tears — by chopping the onions in the processor in two batches.
5004266~Green Onion-Jalapeño Cornbread~3116~345~100~72~67~5221~496~Highly recommended!
5004267~Salmon Hash with Horseradish-Dill Cream~1688~256~52~27~58~7924~180~This brunch dish makes delicious use of leftover cooked salmon or potatoes.

5017005~Lemon Coleslaw~424~55~34~11~14~1007~20~Highly recommended!
5004275~Smoked Oyster and Potato Salad with Arugula~531~68~8~6~27~1~0~We thought of this dish as a main course for lunch, but it would also be great for dinner, particularly with grilled steak. (Serves four as a starter or side dish.)
5004276~Tomato, Cucumber, and Pita Salad~3513~121~17~23~330~6537~17~We seasoned this salad — based on the Middle Eastern bread salad called fattoush — with za'atar, a mixture of salt, sumac, sesame, and thyme.
5004277~Barbecued Ribs with Corn and Black-Eyed-Pea Salad~1562~307~67~44~16~1776~15~Add corn bread, a crunchy chicory salad, and peach pie for summer supper at its best.

5004280~Fresh Oranges with Spiced Red Wine Syrup~549~112~108~0~0~1~0~Fruit with a spiced wine syrup is a typical — and refreshing — ending to a hearty Spanish dinner. Serve with slices of lemon sponge cake if desired.

5008966~Grilled Coconut Poundcake Sundaes With Tropical Fruit~1033~157~152~3~36~503~100~Be sure to clean the grill rack thoroughly with a metal brush to remove any bits of grilled food that might impart an off flavor to the cake. Reheat the cake on a baking sheet in a 350°F oven before serving.
5004283~Peach-Amaretto Sundaes~4073~505~474~47~219~762~605~Juicy peaches, crushed cookies and vanilla ice cream spiked with brandy and amaretto add up to a perfect summer treat.
5004284~Plum Applesauce~273~73~69~0~0~0~0~Only one more fruit is added to this vibrant red applesauce, yet its fragrance and tastiness seem to triple. Smooth and elegant, it complements roast meats and makes a wonderful dessert on its own.

5004294~Rosemary Cookies with Tomato Jam~2873~344~147~96~185~1164~510~"At a dinner at an Italian vinoteca, on the dessert menu was something I'd never seen before: ricotta-stuffed eggplant with candied orange and chocolate sauce. My curiosity piqued, I placed an order with the waiter, only to have him come back with ""You won't like it. Order something else."" Not one to be easily swayed from ordering an intriguing dessert, I ordered it in spite of his admonition, and you know what? I liked it—quite a bit, in fact."
5004295~Gratin Dauphinoise (Scalloped Potatoes)~6387~1158~262~131~118~32072~276~This classic French dish is originally made without cheese. It is the starch from the potatoes, and the cream and milk, which give the dish its cheesy taste while the leek and garlic gently infuse their flavors into the potatoes. Of course if you prefer you can add some grated gruyère to the top along with the cream.

This dish—quinoa prepared risotto-style—is so good, you'll forget it's good for you. Quinoa, whose name means ""mother grain,"" is indigenous to Peru and dates from the time of the Inca civilization. Compared with other grains, quinoa is very high in protein and relatively low in carbohydrates. If you're pressed for time, we found a great substitute for fresh clam broth."

5004310~Cedar Planked Salmon with Maple Glaze and Mustard Mashed Potatoes~974~236~219~9~3~2631~10~Plank cooking is a Native American technique that imparts a subtle smoky flavor to fish, meat, poultry, and vegetables. It is recommended to use a plank of untreated Western red cedar made specifically for cooking purposes.
5004311~Chocolate-Almond Soufflé Torte~7497~433~318~118~546~1782~1310~Enjoy this dessert at room temperature if you like a creamy texture similar to that of a soufflé, or serve the cake cold if you prefer a dense, fudgey texture.
5004312~Banana Cream Pie with Salty Bourbon Caramel~6668~663~489~143~430~4485~836~"This showstopper is a worthwhile project. Set aside some time 2 days ahead to make the components, then practice saying ""Aw shucks, that was nothing!"" to raving guests."
5004313~Chilaquiles in Chipotle Sauce~1333~29~22~33~113~3163~377~Chilaquiles en Salsa de Chipotle
5017226~Wild Garlic and White Bean Curry~1311~258~100~10~12~11100~10~The beauty and subtlety of wild garlic makes this dish very appealing, and fresh curry leaves add a fragrance that is quite seductive. During the summer months, we shell fresh coco beans and cook them directly in the curry until soft. In winter, we soak dried cannellini beans overnight and precook them in water for an hour or so over gentle heat, with one or two herbs added for flavor. I like to serve this curry just as it is, but you could add chunks of white fish to it.
5004315~Quinoa and Bulgur Salad with Feta~758~24~10~3~42~3450~0~Made with crisp radishes, salty olives, and feta, and dressed with minted olive oil and lemon, this salad really sings.
5004317~Red Cabbage, Blue Cheese, and Walnut Empañadas~2360~271~240~18~129~5839~4~This may be an unusual combination of ingredients and flavors for empanadas, but the pairing of cabbage, blue cheese, and walnuts is a classic that makes a wonderful cold-weather dish. While these empanadas would serve as a delicious and hearty vegetarian main course with the addition of rice and beans, I love these flavors with pork.
5004318~Stir-Fried Sesame Baby Bok Choy~643~60~18~2~22~2742~0~Baby bok choy ranges in length from 3 to 5 inches. It's harvested young, and its tender texture makes it ideal for steaming, boiling, or stir-frying. Here, the finished dish has a nice nutty aroma from the sesame oil drizzled on at the end. Any number of stir-fries, including Kung Pao Chicken and Sweet and Sour Pork , would benefit from having this simple vegetable dish on the side.
5004319~Beer-Simmered Grilled Sausages~4795~173~102~187~358~14980~811~Highly recommended!
5004320~Halibut Fish Sticks with Dill-Caper Tartar Sauce~2780~222~10~171~137~2995~252~A coating of egg and panko (rather than a heavy batter) makes these lighter than the average fish stick. Plus, theyre sautéed rather than deep-fried.
5004321~Asian Chicken Hot Pot with Sesame and Garlic Dipping Sauces~1506~152~31~61~46~7388~55~For this interactive dinner, use a camping or induction burner at the table, or just get cozy around a warm stove. As the broth cooks the chicken and vegetables, it becomes a flavorful homemade soup.
5004322~Lamb Burgers in Pita with Yogurt Sauce~2110~230~169~118~84~6044~402~Called tzatziki in Greece, this yogurt sauce can also be used on a baked potato as a nonfat alternative to sour cream. To prevent the pita bread in this recipe from getting soggy, place the trimmed portion of the bread down into the pocket to act as a sponge for the lamb drippings and yogurt.

5004327~Beef Cheeks Braised in Red Wine with Orange Zest (Joues de Boeuf aux Agrumes)~2359~319~210~95~74~5053~152~The flavor of the wine looms large in this meaty braise, lending an extraordinary savoriness to the melt-in-your-mouth carrots.
5004328~Mashed Kohlrabi With Brown Butter~2231~336~67~33~77~10087~189~It's a pain, but you have to peel the kohlrabi for this recipe. Take off enough of the purple or green skin to reveal the inner white flesh.
5004329~Grilled Rib-Eyed Steaks with Béarnaise Butter~323~1~0~0~34~1~94~Highly recommended!
5004330~Red-Braised Pork (Hong Shao Rou)~1061~177~103~7~29~1074~0~Red-braised pork may be one of the most common of all Chinese dishes, but it is also one of the most glorious, a slow stew of belly pork with seasonings that may include sugar, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine and spices. Every region seems to have its own version: this is my favorite, based on recipes I've gathered in eastern China. If my experience is anything to go by, you won't have any leftovers. My guests tend to finish every last morsel and usually end up scraping the pot. If your guests are more restrained, leftover red-braised pork keeps very well for a few days in the refrigerator and a good spoonful makes a wonderful topping for a bowl of noodles. I don't recommend freezing it, however, as this ruins the delicate texture of the fat.
5004331~Cold Asian Noodle Salad with Chicken and Cucumbers~6191~686~105~305~302~31821~1173~Highly recommended!

5004333~Asparagus Green Onion Sauté~521~49~15~26~30~235~10~Passover falls at the cusp of spring, and fresh asparagus on the table is one of the best ways to usher in the new season. Combined with the snap of green beans and sautéed with the silky, mild bite of green onions, it becomes a welcome pop of color and texture to the plate.

I would love to have the recipe for chef Stephen Gontram's wonderful chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and herb-roasted tomatoes."""
5004339~Caramelized Pistachio, Walnut, and Almond Tart~6224~597~215~141~371~2491~314~This candy-like tart with hints of rose, orange, and cloves was inspired by the delicate flavor of baklava. Serve it on its own or with honey-sweetened strained plain yogurt.

5004341~Cherry-Apricot Yogurt Sundaes~937~207~133~21~0~395~18~Though you could certainly use regular red cherries in this recipe, we prefer yellow cherries such as Royal Ann or Rainier, available in supermarkets, for their lovely yellow color, as well as their bright flavor and mild sweetness.

5004351~Smoked Turkey, Blue Cheese, and Red Onion Sandwiches~2562~90~38~103~200~5772~460~To take the sandwiches on a picnic, use ciabatta rolls—they will stay firm despite the mayo.
5004352~Rösti with Black Forest Ham and Chives~2869~439~93~54~95~14896~559~This classic Swiss potato pancake and the Green Bean and Red Onion Salad are great together. Serve dry Champagne throughout the meal.
5008518~Pasta All'uovo (Egg Dough)~140~0~0~12~10~140~370~As important as it is to develop feel and instinct when making dough, there is a metric formula for making pasta all'uovo. The Bolognesi love them. For every 100 grams of flour, use 1 50–55 gram egg (net weight, i.e., without the shell), which corresponds to 1 USDA medium egg. Your kitchen scale is almost certainly bilingual, and it is much easier to use the metric system for this than fractions of ounces, but it works out to 1 3/4 to 2 ounces of egg for every 3 1/2 ounces of flour.
5004354~Egg Curry with Tomatoes and Cilantro~999~123~22~21~43~6198~372~While this easy curry is super satisfying served over rice or with naan, we wrapped it in some leftover crepes for a convincing dosa-like experience.

5004361~Fall Fruits and Vegetables~3064~285~199~12~215~7654~214~The lavish efforts involved — the vegetables are braised, then marinated, and finally sautéed — result in a succulent savory casserole that's spicy with pepper and juniper berries and sweet and sour with cherry nectar and vinegar; each vegetable gives the sweet and sour a slightly different twist. The chestnuts, cooked with salt pork, are particularly wonderful, salty and satisfying. Begin preparations at least 7 hours ahead of serving, since the vegetables must marinate for 6 hours.
5004362~Salmon with Sesame-Peppercorn Crust~843~20~3~7~82~990~63~Highly recommended!
5013275~Pineapple Rum Cocktails~4554~1593~318~10~0~0~0~This tasty pineapple rum cocktail is everything a tropical drink should be: sweet, fruity, and icy cold.

5004367~Watermelon and Feta Salad~889~78~70~42~50~2393~167~In Big Timber, a town of seventeen hundred people just northeast of us, lives Susan Pauli, a great gal and wonderful cook who is in great demand as a caterer. She makes this unusual summer creation as soon as the local watermelons have ripened. The pink color is gorgeous, and the salad travels well. Who would have thought that feta cheese and black pepper together would enhance the taste of watermelon?
5004368~Rosemary and Garlic Roasted Potatoes~3717~705~134~67~57~20175~0~Rosemary's piney scent is so particular you could never mistake it for any other herb. A handful of sprigs (left over from Beef Sautéed with White Wine and Rosemary ) mingle with garlic to cast a spell over roasted potatoes, resulting in something that's just right on a winter night.
5004369~Brown Oatmeal Soda Bread~3845~577~58~268~33~7233~4~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5004371~Vine Leaf-Wrapped Sheep's-Milk Ricotta with Fennel and Olives~1371~32~0~48~124~2911~0~Although we prefer the taste and texture of sheep's-milk ricotta, this recipe can be made using (whole-milk) cow's-milk ricotta, which should first be drained overnight in a cheesecloth-lined sieve set over a bowl. The grapevine leaves make for a beautiful presentation, but, because they haven't been softened in water, they should not be eaten.
5004372~Eggs Florentine Plus~1292~48~13~86~82~4688~684~The traditional egg and spinach dish is embellished with smoked turkey and porcini mushrooms.
5004373~Lentil Soup Kuppin~3535~464~112~235~146~50677~153~Highly recommended!

5004376~Fluffy Baked Eggs with Roasted-Vegetable Hash~1656~107~45~50~111~4335~487~Light in texture yet satisfyingly rich, this elegant one-dish brunch surprises with its earthy depth.
5004377~Chocolate-Amaretti Tortes~4465~371~333~69~317~956~880~Highly recommended!
5004378~Fruit Salad Buffet~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~An added pleasure of this salad lunch is that you can mix your own. Take a large tray and line it with grape leaves or large flat leaves of leaf lettuce. In the center place a shallow dish piled high with heart leaves of lettuce, watercress and spikes of French endive. Around this dish, on the grape leaves, arrange fruits according to your liking, such as:
5004379~Pasta with 15-Minute Ham, Pea, and Cream Sauce~1362~41~21~4~135~418~314~Grated lemon zest gives this creamy classic a hit of bright flavor and a little added flair.
5004380~Fettucine Carbonara with Fried Eggs~1754~222~0~73~56~1156~819~The fried eggs add extra unctuousness to a clever carbonara.
5004381~Roast Beef Vegetable Hash~950~24~18~46~74~2744~500~A diced confetti-style hash is a great way to use leftover meat and vegetables.
5004382~Chicken Fricassée with Carrots, Mustard Greens and Avgolemono Sauce~1639~111~53~23~106~3044~370~Avgolemono, a classic Greek sauce flavored with lemon juice and thickened with eggs, adds richness to the tender stewed chicken in this outstanding main course. Pour a chilled Chardonnay, and offer purchased baklava for dessert.
5004383~Mashed Potatoes with Caramelized Garlic and Parsnips~6870~1179~274~119~166~30781~270~Since roasting brings out the best in most vegetables, food editor Melissa Roberts decided to throw the potatoes into the oven along with the garlic and parsnips, their companions in this dish. The result is an earthy mash, with chunks of caramelized parsnip and savory-sweet garlic.
5004384~Chawan Mushi with Shrimp and Spring Peas~710~80~9~34~21~1550~380~If you've never made a savory custard, now's the time. Start with this minimal and delicate Japanese version, studded with fresh peas and tender shrimp.
5004385~Grilled Gazpacho Salad with Shrimp~3344~238~41~176~187~4930~1330~All of the ingredients that make gazpacho so yummy — tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, and bell peppers — turn up in this main-course salad.
5004387~Curly Endive and Apple Smoked Bacon Salad~4717~138~1~214~370~11064~454~Highly recommended!
5004388~Mustard Aspic~937~59~59~112~24~770~370~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5005758~Potato Latkes~8734~1325~174~187~325~30832~370~Potato latkes are really just potato kugel in pancake form.
5004390~Grilled Tuna and Mango Salad~568~52~22~11~35~645~0~A colorful, delicious dish from Lantana's Restaurant, Grand Cayman, West Indies.
5004391~Chocolate, Cinnamon, and Hazelnut Thumbprints~5157~699~417~126~284~2045~658~These decadent cookies make the most of their headlining ingredients. The hazelnuts are toasted, which deepens their sweetness and makes them the perfect complement to a luscious dark chocolate and cinnamon pairing.
5004392~Crab and Cucumber Pastries with Mustard Sauce~1466~85~24~63~86~3006~443~Highly recommended!
5004393~Ginger Scallion Egg-Drop Soup~279~19~6~18~13~1499~380~It's only natural to use leftover chicken broth (from Blade Steaks with Rosemary White–Bean Purée ) to make chicken soup. But what a soup! Steeping ginger and scallion greens in the stock and then poaching the chicken in it is a quick way to achieve a depth of flavor. The final soup is enriched with silky ribbons of just–cooked eggs, shreds of tender chicken, and fresh rings of scallion. Best of all, this satisfying soup is easy enough to pull together after work.
5008416~Cranberry-Teriyaki Glaze~1571~278~237~17~41~7217~0~Editor's note: The recipe below is from Ming Tsai's book, Ming's Master's Recipes.
5004395~Chocolate Soufflé~3027~366~293~50~170~1844~420~Highly recommended!
5013073~Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting~901~239~239~0~0~1~0~Highly recommended!
5004397~Squid and Pork Noodle Salad~3980~436~26~195~146~5983~230~The squid in this entrée is tender and picks up the flavors it's cooked with.
5004398~Pork Scaloppine with Sun-Dried Tomatoes and Rosemary~756~79~9~49~15~3409~100~Using sun-dried tomatoes that are not packed in oil cuts down on fat. You can find them at some supermarkets, specialty foods stores and Italian markets.
5004399~Rum-Punch Granita~897~182~161~2~20~35~0~To serve as a drink, freeze until just slushy but not solid. Look for Angostura bitters in the liquor section of the supermarket.
5004400~"Chinese-Hawaiian ""Barbecued"" Ribs"~4176~294~248~304~200~17805~1130~Highly recommended!
5016949~Mango-Banana Cake~4796~786~365~79~155~2496~627~Tender banana cake, Cream Cheese Frosting and Mango Curd (see recipes) stack up to one impressive dessert.
5015776~Chicken Fajitas~273~40~35~21~0~2942~45~The chicken cooks quickly. Check often so that it doesn't overcook
5004403~Cajun Seafood Pasta~4630~474~27~440~210~13354~1182~Highly recommended!
5004404~Stuffed Rolled Tortillas~2110~92~11~95~153~4709~341~One of the best ways I know of serving a dish the second time around is to dress up the leftovers in tortillas, bake them in a spaghetti sauce, and top them with crunchy stuff. Even a picky kid might not recognize last night's dinner — if you're lucky.
5004405~Pear and Pumpkin Pie~6080~489~450~286~319~14231~1452~Highly recommended!
5004406~Wild Turkey Glazed Ribs~787~126~45~28~15~7004~54~The slow-sipping, mellow character of bourbon has always suited my palate, in a glass and as an ingredient. Compared to the sophisticated, somewhat standoffish refinement of brandy, bourbon is sturdy and straightforward in the kitchen. Always searching for a way to use bourbon, I've discovered that its sweet, no-nonsense flavor is perfectly at home in this garlicky glaze where it adds depth and a sweet edge to the taste. The recipe makes enough glaze for two racks of spareribs, but it can be doubled if you need more. Serve with collard greens and baked sweet potatoes.
5004408~Chicken-Fried Steak with Sausage Gravy~2123~475~30~103~0~1731~8~This dish is emblematic of great home-style Southern cooking. Some say its origins are in Europe, where wiener schnitzel was invented, and there are some similarities. The connection ends, though, with the country-style sausage gravy with which we smother our pan-fried cutlets. Europeans serve their version with a humble (and lean) wedge of lemon. I retained the gravy but lightened it up dramatically���and instead of pan-frying the cutlets in bacon fat as they do in some parts of the South, I chose to bread and bake them.
5004409~Glazed Strawberry Pie~734~178~113~7~0~25~0~The Beranbaum family fell in love with this pie at a diner called Big Boy in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. We were addicted to this pie, consisting of a crisp crust filled only with fresh strawberries held together by a fruit juice glaze. We would drive fifty miles to Big Boy every weekend just to have it. When I tried to duplicate it in my kitchen, I discovered that a fruit glaze also works well with fresh raspberries or a mixture of raspberries and currants. The glaze preserves the freshness of the fruit for two days.
5004410~Brandy Cobbler~224~31~28~1~10~5~0~Highly recommended!
5004411~Baked Chicken with Barbecue Sauce~676~105~95~15~15~3739~62~A century ago, spicy English mustards like Colman's were too pungent for American tastes, even in small quantities: Back then, mustard was used only in salad dressings. George French came along in 1904 with a formula for a milder condiment he called French’s Cream Salad Mustard. Eventually slathered on everything from bologna sandwiches to soft pretzels, French’s mustard is also delicious in this barbecue sauce.

5004416~Beets with Mint and Yogurt~605~97~29~16~8~1861~18~"A word of warning: I have a friend who at first refused to eat this dish because of its color, a wild, alarming fuschia. He complained that it did not look ""natural."" Since then he has been persuaded. The taste, he said, won him over."
5004417~Oatmeal, Date, Pecan and Chocolate Chip Cookies~4685~697~411~66~189~4244~258~Highly recommended!
5004418~Cocoa Meringue Baskets with Nectarines, Berries, and Cream~1864~137~107~17~126~195~475~Instead of using a pastry bag to pipe the meringue for the baskets, just snip a corner off a resealable plastic bag. Begin preparing this one day ahead.
5017327~Cuban Grilled Pork (Lechon Asado)~5328~42~6~511~316~19027~1470~Editor's note: Chef, nutritionist, and cooking teacher Lourdes Castro shared this recipe from her cookbook, Latin Grilling. It's a classic Cuban dish and the centerpiece of a festive party menu she created for Epicurious. If you have leftover pork, Castro recommends making Grilled Cuban Sandwiches .

5004421~Kingston II~420~117~27~1~7~0~0~Highly recommended!
5004422~Caribbean Coconut Curry Sauce~0~5~2~2~0~1264~0~Brush this slightly sweet lime-scented sauce on shrimp or chicken before and during grilling. The recipe makes enough for 1 1/2 pounds of chicken or shrimp, with some left over to pass at the table.
5004423~Apple-Clove Butter~3081~781~672~0~0~550~0~Highly recommended!
5004424~Sauce Gribiche~2225~6~0~22~230~4244~374~A great sauce to serve with tongue , this is essentially a mayonnaise, but the egg yolks are cooked instead of raw. I like to make a lot and then keep it in the refrigerator to eat with cold ham too. It's also good as a salad dressing.
5004425~Spicy Straw Potatoes~6235~17~5~1~662~6910~0~Russet potatoes are the classic choice for baking but also are best for frying. Because they’re high in starch and low in moisture, they make crisper fries. And don’t refrigerate potatoes for frying; the sugars that accumulate cause very rapid browning and the fries can turn bitter.
5004427~Cream of Tomato Soup with Souffléed Cheese Toasts~1960~119~58~87~128~5070~381~This quick soup, an American classic, makes a fine pairing with a grilled cheese sandwich or crisp romaine salad. Here the grilled cheese sandwich takes a different form—a souffléed Cheddar topping on a good piece of toasted sandwich bread. Use an organic brand of tomatoes, one that's thick with puree as well as chunks of tomato.
5004428~Lamb Chops with Spicy Peanut Sauce~326~36~35~14~11~2996~0~Look for peanut sauce in the Asian foods section of the supermarket. Serve with: Couscous and a cucumber-romaine salad tossed with mint-yogurt dressing. Dessert: Mango sorbet and coconut macaroons.
5004429~Blue Claw Crab Boil with Asian Condiments~407~53~16~1~0~6783~0~You can use any kind of crab, or even dip lump crabmeat in the sauces.
5004430~Conch Salad, Man!~3091~417~144~65~139~8641~158~"""Hey. Hey. I'm Frank, the Conch Salad Man. I'll sell you the world's best conch salad!"" He was holding a huge white pickle bucket brimming with his conch salad. With no more explanation than that, he reached in and gave me a paper cup full. I tipped back a mixture of finely diced conch, tomatoes, red onions, Scotch bonnets, bell peppers, celery, citrus juices and herbs. The flavors of the sea were in there, too. Living in Key West was my culinary university; I never needed more formal training. The place was filled with honest, in-your-face flavors that came from the Cuban, Bahamian and African-American residents and wanderers who passed through. I didn't move to Key West to re-invent the cuisine—I came to find a home. In the process, I found a path to both. In this recipe, you will taste the foundation of each."
5017258~Cardamom Spice Blend~36~7~7~0~0~295~0~Cardamom is a spice not commonly used in the United States. A member of the ginger family, this warm, sweet spice is traditionally found in Indian cooking, flavoring a wide variety of curries, rice dishes, and Indian-style desserts.
5004432~Chocolate-Pistachio Torte with Warm Chocolate Ganache~8262~630~461~138~648~2487~1568~There will be a bit of pistachio paste left over: stir it into your next batch of brownies.
5004433~Ham and Cheese Griddle Cakes~3105~279~45~75~70~1865~496~Highly recommended!
5004434~Herbed Balsamic Chicken with Blue Cheese~633~40~37~18~43~4643~45~This dish requires just four ingredients (aside from oil, salt, and pepper). Serve with an arugula salad.
5004435~Karo Classic Pecan Pie~3947~571~430~37~197~1517~433~Attention pecan pie lovers! Here's a classic recipe using a classic American brand.
5004436~Currant Scones~2836~590~68~79~0~2492~5~Scones are the classic tea and coffee partner. Tiny and elegant for a silver-service tea or as large as a fist, they're everyone's favorite served warm, split and spread with butter or whipped cream and jam.
5004438~Pierogies with Tomatoes, Browned Onions, and Dill~592~39~10~5~45~1124~3~Like an eastern European take on ravioli, this embodiment of Polish comfort food is right at home in a lively tomato sauce with dill and caraway seeds.

5004443~Brussels Sprouts with Shallots and Wild Mushrooms~3373~24~8~3~369~3325~214~Your suspicions are confirmed: We did have the classic green-bean casserole with fried-onion topping on the brain when working on this recipe. But sweet, nutty roasted Brussels sprouts and a woodsy blend of wild mushrooms will make this luxurious variation a hit on even the most traditional holiday table. The fried shallots provide an irresistible savory crunch.

5004450~Charred Octopus with Peach, Arugula and Aged Balsamic~1396~87~34~100~67~5040~962~Learning to cook octopus properly is important because it can become a bit rubbery if not prepared correctly. This recipe teaches a great technique. The richness of the aged balsamic vinegar, the brightness of the peach, and the peppery bite of arugula come together in a harmonious way that celebrates all of the flavors, especially the octopus.
5004451~Roasted Hot-Honey Shrimp With Bok Choy and Kimchi Rice~2468~240~78~184~97~6909~1392~We love the way this cooking method lightly chars the bok choy and intensifies the natural sweetness and juiciness of the shrimp. And roasting them together leaves you with plenty of time to whip up a gently spicy, savory batch of kimchi rice to serve alongside.
5004452~Marinated Flank Steak~422~16~9~8~34~411~26~Highly recommended!
5004453~Banana Rum Ice Cream~1880~345~297~39~44~866~65~Highly recommended!
5004454~Potato and Celery Root Mash~5378~909~189~102~131~27975~63~This mash gets a punch of flavor from freshly grated horseradish. Use a combination of potato varieties to add more texture.

5004456~Barbecue-Spiced Grilled Tenderloin Steaks~57~14~14~0~0~94~0~"All the flavors of a downhome barbecue sauce combined in a dry ""rub"" that won't mask the flavor of the steaks."
5004457~Cheddar, Bacon, and Scallion Soufflé~1677~55~35~80~136~6817~633~Highly recommended!
5004458~Deep-Dish Apple Pie with Cheddar Crust~5415~871~332~114~156~2245~466~While apple pie has an all-American reputation, both the fruit and the dessert are of European origin. However, several centuries of apple cultivation and dessert baking have given us de facto ownership, and the pie has become a must on many Thanksgiving tables. Cheese was produced by many of the German dairies in and around Philadelphia. The pie has no bottom crust and is baked in an oval dish, so it resembles a cobbler.
5004460~Mixed Greens and Fruit with Mustard Dressing~1461~204~60~67~45~3956~96~The fruit in the salad can be varied with the season. In summer, add cantaloupe; in winter, oranges are good.
5004461~Prosciutto with Melon~249~7~7~28~10~1656~89~Highly recommended!
5018485~Fried Rice with Pork and Kale~2054~359~24~50~35~2220~14~Cold cooked rice (made at least 1 day ahead) is the secret to delicious fried rice, so don't cook a fresh pot for this recipe.

5004465~Roasted Pork Tenderloin with Apples~692~45~16~44~35~1919~150~Pork tenderloin is a lean, quick-cooking cut of meat. Here it's roasted with apples and served with warm barley.
5004466~Couscous Salad with Corn and Red Bell Pepper~528~56~10~3~28~361~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5004467~Pasta with Tomatoes and Goat Cheese~250~3~3~17~21~536~71~The goat cheese, when tossed with the hot pasta, melts and becomes a creamy sauce. We've learned that it's a good idea to taste your goat cheese before using it (or before buying it, if possible — one of the soft goat cheeses we tried seemed a bit too strong for this dish).
5004483~Fennel and Endive Salad with Orange Vinaigrette~403~12~8~0~41~485~0~Highly recommended!
5004469~Chinese Orange Chicken~5654~185~37~86~523~1414~404~Orange chicken is a Chinese-restaurant favorite for good reason. Think of it as a Chinese-American version of fried chicken nuggets coated in a savory citrus sauce punctuated with a light touch of chile heat. What's not to love? Making it at home—instead of resorting to takeout—is much easier than you might think, and probably involves about as much time as it takes to find the menu online and wait, wait, wait for the delivery. And we guarantee you will be bowled over by the layers of flavor and texture!
5004470~Maple Pumpkin Pie~1879~242~232~12~104~1215~684~Highly recommended!
5004471~Minted Turkish Delight Marinade~1056~205~19~8~0~2095~9~Mint and spices add a Turkish flair to this yogurt-based marinade. The flavors are perfect with lamb kebabs or chicken. It's also a good dip for crudités or pita bread.

5004476~Carrot Cake with Maple-Cream Cheese Icing~13149~1628~1211~135~712~6062~808~A standard at health food restaurants across the country, carrot cake was ubiquitous in the seventies. Grated carrots made it a nutritious choice, or so the thinking went. This ultra-moist version is updated with a maple icing.
5014270~Beef Tenderloin with Spring Vegetables~1308~78~34~57~78~4194~149~Stew made with lamb may be known as the national dish, but beef is actually the most popular meat today. It turns up everywhere, including Tinakilly House in Rathnew, Ireland, where they offer this lovely dish. It's served with Champ (Green Onion Mashed Potatoes).
5004478~Mixed-Herb Pasta with Red Bell Peppers and Feta~3522~380~19~111~153~5245~251~Use almost any combination of fresh herbs here (watch the tarragon, mint, and sage, since they're more assertive). Accompany this meatless dish with a salad (maybe arugula and radicchio with a red wine vinaigrette) and some seeded breadsticks. Then add a rich dessert, such as an almond tart from the bakery.
5012191~Beer-Can Chicken~0~0~0~0~0~4613~0~There's quite a bit of lore surrounding beer-can chicken, and for good reason. Just look at that burnished mahogany bird. The steam from the brew flavors the meat and keeps it moist. The can props the chicken up, so it roasts evenly—no scorching, no flipping, no stressing. And you get to drink some beer. We're believers.
5014498~Perfect White Rice~1924~372~0~30~36~3877~0~"Rice is a staple of Latin cuisines, and growing up in a Cuban family, I probably took it for granted. It was only when I left home that I realized how important well-cooked rice can be, both for the soul and other foods on the plate! I always try to impress on people that it's a sin to use converted or instant rice. It's got to be ""real"" rice, and preferably long-grain. Avoid flavoring rice, for that will detract from the flavors of the foods you're serving the rice with."
5004484~Parsley, Red Onion, and Pomegranate Salad~461~24~15~0~41~2~0~Yes, you can treat parsley as a salad green, as long as your bunch isn't woody. Sweet molasses and tart sumac make it vibrant.
5004485~Fresh Cranberry Orange Sauce~556~155~143~0~0~1~0~Highly recommended!
5004486~Peruvian-Style Roast Chicken With Tangy Green Sauce~836~91~8~5~42~5081~10~This cumin- and paprika-spiced number gets added punch from an addictively tangy green sauce and a crisp, bright avocado and cucumber salad. Spatchcocking—an easy and fun technique that involves removing the backbone to “flatten” the bird before cooking—makes for quick roasting and produces juicy results.
5004487~Poached Oysters in Fennel-Saffron Soup~1283~33~0~0~114~0~377~Serve this with plenty of crusty bread.
5004488~Coconut, Caramel, and Rum Flans~1468~140~136~9~87~299~318~"Eli Gorelick of West Orange, New Jersey, writes: ""As a kid growing up in Cuba, I worked alongside my mother every day in the kitchen, learning how to make specialties like picadillo and fried bananas. I still think Havana has the best Cuban food in the world, and I continue to love the recipes I learned during my childhood."""
5004489~Grilled Paillards of Beef with Red Wine and Port Sauce~193~13~6~0~14~20~0~At Mirabelle, chef Reuge serves the paillards, in this case thin slices of strip steak, on a bed of red cabbage braised in red wine and garnishes the dish with fresh herbs.
5004490~Wheat-Berry Salad with Grilled Tofu~4313~538~194~51~233~97691~10~Studded with delectably nutty wheat berries, this substantial salad of charred tomatoes, peppers, and tofu truly deserves its billing as a main course.
5004491~Wine-Braised Brisket of Beef with Caramelized Pearl Onions and Dried Apricots~6031~680~189~224~272~19706~794~Editor's note: This recipe is from chef Wolfgang Puck.

5004494~N'awlins Butter Beans with Andouille~219~32~15~10~4~1503~34~Some say it isn't soul food unless it's mashed, creamed, candied, or deep-fried. But Southern cuisine needn't swim in saturated fat: Witness the recipes in Dr. Ro's Ten Secrets to Livin' Healthy (Bantam Dell Books) by nutritionist Rovenia Brock, Ph.D. With this delicious down-on-the-Delta dish, Brock slashes the fat while upping the nutritional ante with picks high in vitamin A, beta-carotene, and lycopene. You get a meal that's good for your heart and soul.
5016308~Baguette Toasts~516~60~2~10~27~660~0~This recipe was created to accompany Chilled Tarragon Tomato Soup with Vegatable Confetti .
5004496~Cauliflower and Shrimp Caldin~804~55~13~22~48~4653~194~A caldin is a coconut curry, typical of Goa. Though caldins are made with fresh coconut milk in India, chef Cardoz uses Chaokoh brand canned unsweetened coconut milk. It's thicker and richer than other brands, and imparts a great deal of flavor. It's important not to let the caldin boil during cooking, or the coconut sauce will break.
5004497~Medallions of Pork with Dried Cherry Sauce~259~2~2~2~28~1874~0~It is very easy to overcook pork chops. In this recipe,you can first sauté them until brown and then add a little broth to maintain their moisture. Open a bottle of Gamay Beaujolais to have with dinner.

5004506~Moroccan Chicken and Lentils~1574~185~24~148~18~12988~306~A blend of cumin, chili powder, and cinnamon gives this dish its Moroccan flair.

5004508~Date Nut Cookie Pies~2507~565~247~146~56~2288~82~Don't let the humble name fool you. These little cookies are bursting with flavor. They're reminiscent of those fig cookies you had as a kid-raised to the third power. The cream pastry is tender and flaky, and the honey-kissed filling, just sweet enough, is deepened by plump Medjool dates. They're also bite-size and adorable.
5004509~Ham and Sage Ponice~2526~439~0~55~58~524~78~Highly recommended!
5004510~Orange Cheesecake Brownies~2354~312~291~29~116~1545~611~A very moist, fudgy brownie.
5004511~Negrone~110~13~11~0~0~5~0~Highly recommended!
5004512~Braised Duck Legs and Sautéed Duck Breast~1321~272~66~26~9~1505~0~We love how Carena uses every part of the duck: The carcass makes a velvety broth for braising the wings and legs until they're fall- off-the-bone tender; the breast is seared and sprinkled with minced parsley and garlic, so the dish really runs the gamut from deeply meaty to fresh and vibrant.
5016677~Caramelized Onions with Barbecue Sauce~411~42~36~1~27~2274~0~Silky and sweet, these onions add a sophisticated touch to adults' burgers (adventurous younger eaters will enjoy them, too).
5004514~Party Squash Salad~1121~84~45~65~74~2349~156~Use a sharp vegetable peeler to shave the Parmesan cheese into long strips.
5004515~Cool Melon Soup~1925~101~55~26~160~3384~189~To make this slightly sweet dish such a delicious departure from other melon soups, Kinch briefly cooks vibrant Cavaillon and Charentais melons. Feel free to use any of your favorite summer melons, including honeydews or cantaloupes.
5004516~Kale Minestrone with Pistou~4246~504~71~106~193~13417~61~For rave-worthy soups, skip the store-bought stock. You can extract a cleaner, stronger broth from a combination of water and several pantry ingredients. It's all about layering powerful flavorenhancers that you probably already have on hand—bacon, tomato paste, herbs, peppercorns, a Parm rind, and, of course, kosher salt.
5004517~Romaine and Fennel Salad with Red Wine Vinaigrette~1674~4~2~95~152~3560~236~Highly recommended!

5004524~Borscht~684~100~27~9~26~3830~0~To make this borscht into a full meal, serve the butter-braised oysters as a starter, or vice versa.
5004525~Lemon-Pistachio Pilaf~2156~339~27~47~72~996~0~Highly recommended!
5004526~Pork and Apple Pie with Cheddar-Sage Crust~6058~431~104~297~426~9170~1122~My editor, Maria Guarnaschelli, suggested this recipe, based on her memory of a savory pie served at a London pub. One half of the pie was filled with pork and the other with apples. As I later learned, that dish has its roots in an eighteenth-century workingman's lunch called the Bedfordshire Clanger—a hand-held pie filled with meat on one end and jam on the other. It was a compact way to serve lunch and dessert in one package.
5004527~Spicy Crab and Melon Salad~410~19~19~73~5~3189~526~Serve with: Buttermilk biscuits with herb butter, and chilled steamed asparagus spears in a citrus vinaigrette.
5004528~Sea Bass with Citrus-Olive-Caper Sauce~1106~28~6~15~104~4465~49~Keep the feast eco-friendly by buying Mid-Atlantic sea bass and not its overfished southern Atlantic cousin.
5004529~Corsican Greens Pie with Butternut Squash and Three Cheeses~3392~254~30~74~244~6430~114~You'll have extra butternut squash left over after making the ribbons; cut into cubes, toss with olive oil, salt and pepper, and roast for an easy side dish.

5004533~Nutty Monk~1993~71~22~42~183~776~13~Eben Freeman, bartender of Tailor restaurant in New York City, developed this bitter, Cognac-based cocktail, which makes for a great after-dinner drink.
5004534~Two-Grain Pancakes~483~73~23~34~16~1874~56~The Indian staple cornmeal became a mainstay of Colonial cooking; European arrivals used it to stretch their scarce wheat flour. We have adopted the same tactic with our modern edition of the venerable breakfast dish, pancakes. They are, of course, also a good excuse to bring out the maple syrup, another gift from the Indians.

5004545~Smoked Salmon, Cream Cheese, and Dill Stuffed Eggs~511~9~3~25~38~921~464~Highly recommended!
5004546~Oil-Poached Halibut with Tomatoes and Fennel~8105~115~62~8~883~144~0~Fennel and tomatoes go silky when poached in olive oil, and when halibut follows suit, it picks up hints of the vegetables' flavor and becomes succulent and delicately nuanced.
5004547~Peppered Pears, Blue Cheese, and Fried Sage~278~16~10~0~23~0~63~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5004548~Double-Mint Fruit Compote~810~145~55~5~22~19~0~This refreshing mint syrup can flavor any combination of fresh fruits. Leftover syrup is great for sweetening iced tea.
5004549~Spice-Rubbed Pork Tenderloins in Corn Husks with Cranberry-Avocado Salsa~2313~46~6~354~83~2673~921~Tamales are traditionally served in the southwestern United States and in Mexico at Christmas. In this easy do-ahead version, corn husks are wrapped around spicy pieces of pork tenderloin. The husks keep the pork tender and juicy as it cooks. What to drink: Pinot Noir.
5004550~Pecan Spice Layer Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting~11002~1879~1312~119~338~5322~898~Several traditional southern themes — pecans, Caribbean spices, and, of course, thick, tangy cream cheese frosting — come together in this gorgeous layer cake that's both down-home and elegant.

5004555~Rice Noodles with Garlic and Herbs~809~148~48~14~11~13094~0~Highly recommended!
5004556~Grilled Salmon with Orzo, Feta, and Red Wine Vinaigrette~2925~342~28~104~138~2471~167~Salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to lower cholesterol, and it is about as healthy as fish can get. But that is really a side benefit to this great-tasting main-course salad. It fits into the Motivating Mondays scenario, but I would happily serve it any day of the week and for any occasion. The warm orzo salad, with crunchy pine nuts, fresh basil, tender spinach, and tangy feta, is also good on its own. The salmon can also be cooked in a ridged grill pan.
5004557~Oatmeal Wheat Bread~3972~812~146~282~108~6484~274~"This wheat loaf is nothing like your standard ""health bread"" — the oats make it soft and slightly sweet, ideal for sandwiches or buttered toast."
5004559~Braised Chicken with Celery Root and Garlic~1156~89~14~23~74~4837~93~Cooking the garlic inside the skin not only saves time but also mellows the harshness of its flavor and results in tender cloves that can be peeled easily. Squeeze the cloves out of their skins and eat them with the chicken and the bread.
5004561~Vietnamese Pork Chops~334~16~6~24~17~5927~69~Go light on the salt when seasoning these chops; the marinade is fairly salty, especially after it reduces.
5004562~Smoked Chicken and Sugar Snap Pea Salad with Mint~740~99~50~29~23~1163~55~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5004563~Spicy Sweet Corn and Poblano Soup~1402~94~22~24~106~5691~322~Highly recommended!
5004564~Italian Spoon Biscuits with Tomato Sauce and Cheese~1890~117~36~156~117~4577~273~This unusual dish — which combines biscuits, tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese — is a cross between a meatless lasagna and a pizza bread. It's a terrific quick supper; just add a mixed green salad.
5004566~Lamb Chops and Potatoes with Olives, Tomatoes and Feta Cheese~708~57~30~23~43~802~81~Highly recommended!
5004567~Nutmeg-Coated Creamy French Toast~706~98~87~21~23~965~122~Golden crisp on the outside yet tender on the inside, here is the ultimate in French toast. The additional egg yolks give extra richness, body, and color to this twist on the classic. This recipe is perfect for entertaining because it's made the day before. Simply fry and serve in the morning.
5004568~Mulled Wine~2582~665~553~0~0~1596~0~Sticking the cloves into the tangerines means no straining is necessary before serving. Enjoy pre- or post-dinner.
5004569~Cheesy Baked Penne with Cauliflower and Crème Fraîche~6226~273~23~214~485~5503~1600~Cauliflower is a nice surprise and crème fraîche adds some tanginess to this inventive version of macaroni and cheese.
5004570~Mixed Greens with Grapefruit, Fennel, and Parmesan~2156~173~66~72~131~1520~68~Highly recommended!
5004571~Hoppin' John Salad with Molasses Dressing~2120~320~35~25~84~628~0~It is said that eating Hoppin' John on New Year's Day will bring good luck. Here's a fresh take on the southern dish traditionally made with salt pork (we've subbed in andouille sausage) and served over rice.
5004572~Chile-Braised Beef Brisket~3154~234~62~153~184~7901~644~Brisket is commonly used to make corned beef, but I find that it lends itself well to other preparations. And once it's in the oven, you can forget about it for hours—it's that easy to prepare. This brisket with a south-of-the-border kick is one of my very favorites. The meat actually tastes better to me when it sits overnight so all the flavors have more time to marry. It will hold well for a few days. While good reheated the next day, the meat served cold in a sandwich is a delicious alternative to leftovers.
5004573~Acorn Squash Stuffed with Wild Rice, Hazelnuts and Dried Cranberries~2022~417~31~34~23~191~63~Highly recommended!
5004574~Red Berry Frappé~938~134~112~19~32~544~120~Highly recommended!
5004575~Turkish Lamb Burgers~2559~265~212~163~110~7953~560~A cold couscous salad and steamed carrots sprinkled with mint would be lovely alongside. Finish with baklava.
5004576~Crab Meat and Beet Purée on Granny Smith Apple~375~22~16~54~5~1101~242~You can make the crab mixture and beet purée ahead of time, but don’t assemble these hors d'oeuvres until just before serving or the apple slices will discolor.
5004577~Pork Noodle Soup with Cinnamon and Anise~3625~201~74~205~232~5836~612~Highly recommended!
5008865~Charred Tomatillo Salsa Verde~457~66~12~2~14~113~0~Highly recommended!
5004579~Surfer's Granola~3866~586~131~101~181~1996~0~Packed with oats, nuts, and seeds, this energy booster can be made up to 1 week ahead. Serve it as a snack, or for breakfast with yogurt and any kind of seasonal fresh fruit.

5004588~Homemade Baking Powder~0~0~0~0~0~7886~0~"Why would you make your own baking powder? ""Because it tastes better,"" says Chef Peacock. By making your own, you're avoiding the chemicals and preservatives that go into commercial baking powder. Peacock has been making baking powder for almost 20 years, since legendary southern cook (and Peacock's dear friend) Edna Lewis turned him on to the homemade stuff."
5017439~Guinness Mustard~174~5~4~0~0~3550~0~Highly recommended!

5004595~Corn-Crusted Red Snapper with Achiote Shrimp~8880~1595~0~269~181~703~444~The signature dish at Américas in Houston. Achiote paste adds earthy flavor and deep red color to the shrimp.
5004596~Mac and Two Cheeses with Caramelized Shallots~3956~310~65~149~224~3863~714~Instead of breadcrumbs, this mac and cheese is topped with rich, pungent caramelized shallots and creamy, crumbled goat cheese.
5004598~Mocha Pecan Pie with Coffee Whipped Cream~7555~922~558~74~403~2151~923~Cocoa, espresso and orange add a sophisticated note to a classic pecan pie.
5004599~Chocolate-Garlic Mojo with Toasted Cuban Bread (Tostadas de Pan Cubano con Mojo de Chocolate)~2307~185~119~13~189~0~32~A sensuous variation on the theme of bread and chocolate is a silky ganache flavored with a garlicky Cuban-style olive oil mojo, smeared over slices of Cuban bread. Because the ingredients are so few and basic, it is important to use a not-too-bitter premium chocolate. I also like the effect of a mellow Spanish extra-virgin olive oil made with Arbequina olives, with their slight accent of apple peel. Sea salt sprinkled on the bread right at the moment of serving brings out all the flavors.
5004600~Basmati Rice with Summer Vegetable Salad~2128~416~17~44~20~214~0~Create endless riffs on this salad by using the bright herb dressing with your favorite grains and vegetables.

5004604~Green Mayonnaise~1528~17~1~0~168~2192~253~Active time: 15 min Start to finish: 2 1/4 hr
5004605~Watermelon with Parmesan and Mint~111~23~10~0~0~488~0~Watermelon chunks in savory salads have been all the rage in the past few years, but we wanted a way to retain the fruit's best trait: how enjoyable it is to eat out of hand on a hot day. These wedges, sprinkled with salt, pepper, cheese, and heady fresh mint, are a light, refreshing start to a warm-weather meal. And they leave your other hand free to hold a drink or chase after the kids.
5018731~Lumpia Rolls~757~76~26~3~44~4529~0~This well-known Philippine starter combines attributes of many of the wrapped foods of other countries. It's filled like an egg roll, has an egg wrapper like a crêpe, and is served warm but not fried. All the components, which can be varied according to what you have in your kitchen, are cooked before assembly.

5004612~Molasses-and-Buttermilk Gingerbread Squares~3627~376~171~116~134~3556~426~Highly recommended!
5004613~Warm Cocoa Pudding With Candied Pecans~4677~382~329~60~351~4572~1035~Makes you wonder why you would ever serve cold pudding again.
5004614~Grilled Corn on the Cob with Garlic Butter, Fresh Lime, and Queso Fresco~1913~68~6~2~173~1007~379~Editor's Note: This recipe was originally part of a menu by Bobby Flay for a backyard barbecue. For the complete menu and Flay's tips on throwing a party, click here.

5004620~Soy Dipping Sauce~394~36~19~42~16~12880~41~We serve this sauce with both the sugar snap pea tempura and the pork and jicama dumplings . If you make only one of these hors d'oeuvres, however, this recipe should be halved.
5004621~Beef Tenderloin with Smoked Paprika Mayonnaise~1903~50~0~4~188~1777~270~Lovers of beef and chorizo can have their steak and eat it, too: Here, a garlic, cumin, and smoked-paprika rub on rare roast beef has the alluring smoky meatiness you've always associated with the richly flavored sausage. The same seasonings, plus some drippings from the meat, transform ordinary store-bought mayonnaise into a simply spectacular accompaniment.
5004623~Blue Cheese and Walnut Toasts~2046~19~4~40~199~2283~351~Highly recommended!
5004624~Thyme Garlic Butter~910~33~0~0~80~1047~214~We like this butter on grilled steak.

5004628~Peppery Pasta Carbonara with Poached Egg~1125~90~0~47~60~1657~134~Pasta and pork—what's not to love? Spaghetti alla carbonara traditionally calls for guanciale (cured pork jowl), but bacon is weeknight-friendly and every bit as satisfying. Raw egg is typically mixed into the hot pasta, but a poached egg on top feels more substantial while still providing the requisite creaminess.
5004629~Greek Lamb Burgers with Spinach and Red Onion Salad~696~67~13~10~44~1616~0~Highly recommended!
5004630~Celery Root, Kohlrabi, and Apple Purée~6675~757~164~97~355~13001~63~Look for kohlrabi, a mildly sweet purple or green vegetable in the cabbage family, at better supermarkets. For a creamier, smoother purée, pass the boiled ingredients twice through a potato ricer or food mill.
5004632~Grilled Ham and Swiss Sandwiches~916~56~2~68~46~2358~194~Serve with: Red cabbage slaw and pickles. Dessert: Fudge brownies.
5004634~Soy-Ginger Beef and Noodle Salad with Peanut Dressing~3052~529~100~89~66~7886~1~Freezing the steak for about 30 minutes makes it much easier to slice; using a grill pan is the simplest way to cook the slices.

5004644~Bibb Lettuce and Celery-Leaf Salad~697~21~9~1~68~994~0~Celery leaves are an underutilized green. Look for the freshest celery possible, which has the most leaves—many grocers trim the leaves as the celery gets older.
5004645~Banana Rum Cream Pie~2682~155~145~7~230~897~696~This voluptuous rum-spiked pie will surprise you with its complexity—a hint of curry powder adds an elusive undertone that makes it particularly delicious.
5004646~Clams with Jalapeño, Lemon, and Basil~762~147~10~412~69~18715~970~Offer crusty bread to dip into the wonderful broth. What to drink: A crisp, citrusy Sauvignon Blanc from California or ice-cold pale ale.
5004647~Orange Chicken with Golden Raisins and Figs~5382~894~332~286~73~23427~517~Dja'jeh Burd'aan b'Teen
5004648~Arugula, Corn, and Tomato Salad with Shaved Parmesan~2057~322~43~69~58~449~0~Fresh kernels of raw corn are so sweet and tender that they don't need to be cooked. Their natural sugars and crisp juiciness pair wonderfully with the salty Parmesan and peppery arugula.
5014185~Honeyed Ricotta~698~36~22~40~40~349~168~This may be my favorite accompaniment in the book. It's wonderful on pretty much everything, especially Buckwheat Crepes or Whole-Grain Buttermilk Pancakes, or stirred into The Very Best Oatmeal. Ricotta is traditionally made from the whey that's left over from the cheese-making process, and it's often extremely mild. This recipe brightens the simple cheese with a combination of honey, vanilla, and lemon zest¿transforming it into a light morning topping that could rival any high-end yogurt or jam.

5004660~Braised Chicken in Aromatic Tomato Sauce~2538~425~156~49~57~18~0~"This dish known, as pastitsatha, is one that evolved from Corfu to stretch scant supplies of meat. Consisting of chicken, turkey, beef or veal braised in tomato sauce fragrant with spices, it is served over thick tubular pasta from Corfu called ""perciatellli"" (if you can't find it, use spaghetti). Kefalotyri is a nutty tasting hard cheese similar to Parmesan. It is available at Greek markets."

5004665~Bacony Roasted Chickpeas~615~0~0~30~53~1462~115~"""I love the crisp texture of this addictive bar snack; the bacon fat is an obvious bonus."" —Alison Roman, assistant food editor"
5004666~Chorizo-Filled Dates~1122~71~65~25~79~1774~59~Highly recommended!
5004667~"""California Roll"" Salad"~2972~467~84~102~75~8569~41~(Sushi Rice Salad with Avocado, Cucumber, and Scallions) Sushi fans will recognize this salad as a California roll unrolled. For those who want to include one of the classic ingredients, surimi (also known as mock crab legs), we've given an amount, but the salad is also delicious without it.
5004668~Rainbow Slaw~3134~246~161~7~253~6785~379~With two hues of cabbage and two kinds of apples, as well as carrots and yams, this multi-colored slaw will look gorgeous on a picnic or buffet table.
5004669~Couscous with Apricots~1215~172~12~34~45~1669~0~This couscous with coriander seeds and apricots is a nice alternative to rice. Try it with roasted chicken or vegetables.
5004670~Chicken Negimaki with Spicy Red Pepper Dipping Sauce~1583~206~135~39~64~5094~55~"In many instances, boneless skinless chicken breasts are sold with ""tenders"" (the small fillet strip containing the white tendon on the underside of each breast half) still attached. If that is the case, simply put each chicken breast—skinned side down—on a work surface, pull off the tenders, and reserve them for other use."
5004671~Rhubarb Roulade~1398~344~266~44~10~143~371~Highly recommended!
5004672~Gluten-Free Vegan Oatmeal Raisin Cookies~2876~504~263~22~84~2486~0~Highly recommended!
5004673~Spinach-Pineapple-Mint Juice~1144~190~107~19~30~1339~0~The mint in this juice ties together the sweet pineapple and tart green apple so well that you won't even notice the spinach.
5004674~Roasted Racks of Lamb with Artichokes, Red Onions, and Garlic Cloves~1178~69~9~12~93~5351~0~Highly recommended!
5004675~Lamb Stew with Black Mustard Seeds~4149~388~281~196~202~9616~735~Highly recommended!
5004676~Roast Veal Brisket with Marsala-Mushroom Sauce~707~136~45~20~0~2288~0~This hearty winter entrée can be prepared several days ahead. Veal brisket is the boned veal breast. If you don't have a roasting pan large enough to hold both briskets, divide the ingredients in half and bake in two pans. If the veal is difficult to find, substitute one 5-pound flat-cut beef brisket and roast until tender, about 3 1/2 hours. Leftovers freeze well and make great sandwiches.
5004677~Turkey Posole~1119~121~24~50~41~2973~130~Highly recommended!
5004678~Rum Refresher~162~39~35~1~0~15~0~Highly recommended!
5004679~Braised Rabbit with Egg Noodles~1695~153~110~62~84~4392~113~More supermarkets are carrying fresh rabbit, as people rediscover its delicate flavor. Braising helps to keep it moist and tender. If you have trouble finding rabbit, however, you can substitute bone-in chicken, skin removed.
5004680~Golden Milk Turmeric Tea~600~71~57~8~34~302~0~This lightly spiced drink (which is similar in flavor to chai) is packed with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, thanks to a dose of peppery turmeric. A touch of honey adds just the right amount of sweetness, while the ginger and black pepper add a little heat.
5004681~Minute Steak with Roasted Fennel and Arugula and Caper Dressing~1402~114~12~29~48~9123~60~A lot of people assume that being healthy means that red meat is off the menu. But I'm delighted to say that it's very much on mine. That said, I am a stickler for ensuring that the meat we eat is of the highest quality and that it is always paired with an abundance of vegetables. Plants are always my main focus, but a little bit of good-quality meat here and there has worked best for me. I have tried being vegan and vegetarian but my health suffered during those phases. We are, after all, omnivores and so, unless you have a specific dislike of, issue with or reaction to meat, I think it's a food group that has an important role in our diet. If you like carpaccio, this recipe also works incredibly well with the beef served raw and very finely sliced.
5004682~Potato and Seafood Salad with Tarragon~6182~1026~204~275~96~33272~1038~Highly recommended!
5004683~Quick Pickled Cucumbers~905~239~237~1~0~5816~0~After lingonberry preserves, these pickled cucumbers are the most popular condiment in Scandinavia. They are a traditional accompaniment to Swedish Meatballs, simple salmon dishes, and roasts and other meats. They are even served with frankfurters sold at street kiosks, much like the sauerkraut that often tops the hot dogs sold here.
5004684~Braised Veal with Gremolata~653~69~0~2~17~1720~0~Gremolata, a mix of finely chopped lemon zest, parsley, and garlic, is an Italian topping classically served with osso buco. We added some basil to make it even livelier.
5004685~Lebanese-Style Tuna Salad with Tahini Dressing~610~91~59~15~20~23759~0~Highly recommended!
5004686~Penne with Fried Sardines, Capers, and Parsley~1118~183~14~28~34~1115~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5005362~Lemon-Oregano Chicken~995~45~6~15~82~1531~125~Chicken thighs are an excellent choice if you're looking for big, meaty flavor that's easy on the wallet. Here, they're seared until the skin is golden-crisp and then roasted with the classic combination of lemon and oregano until juicy.
5004688~Hungarian Blintz Loaf (Palacsinta Felfujt)~1866~171~108~50~119~1913~612~Originally this dish consisted of topfenpalatschinken (Hungarian cheese crêpes) baked in a rich custard. This variation skips the time-consuming process of making blintzes. Double the recipe and bake in a 13-by-9-inch baking pan.
5004689~Seven-Vegetable Couscous with Chunky Onion Harissa~5102~667~219~84~244~3997~54~Highly recommended!

5004691~Slow-Cooker Marrakech Chicken Stew With Preserved Lemon and Olives~5162~184~99~306~331~20165~1594~This pungent, fragrant chicken stew is not for the weak of palate. Radiating the aromas of toasted cumin and coriander, and spiked with the salty-sour pucker of cured lemons and olives, it produces a heady and exotic effect. If you can’t find preserved lemons in your local food markets (high-end stores usually stock them), you can order them or make them yourself.
5004692~Grilled Lemon and Rosemary Chicken~1175~20~10~23~112~2907~103~Offer grilled zucchini slices and a deli pasta salad alongside. Dessert? Berry tartlets from the bakery.
5004693~Dutch Coffee~312~34~31~3~19~33~0~Highly recommended!
5004694~French Apple Tart~2812~339~132~87~185~969~505~This just might be my all-time favorite dessert. It's the simple essence of sweet apples and crisp pastry with no distractions. We've all collected several similar recipes over the years, but this is the best one I've ever made. If I need to make it even faster, I use defrosted frozen puff pastry instead of making the crust (see note), but you'll want to eat it an hour or two after it comes out of the oven.
5004695~Cantaloupe-Basil Agua Fresca~1401~339~311~26~0~684~0~Highly recommended!
5004696~Instant Borscht with Confit Duck~384~21~10~14~28~3367~76~We tweaked this Old World sweet-and-sour dish with confit duck, and the amazing result knocked us out.

5004701~Ham and Munster Buns with Honey Mustard~1788~394~49~210~35~9120~199~Highly recommended!
5004702~Bratwurst with Creamy Apple Compote~1042~49~36~14~70~3361~145~Split and browned bratwurst provides contrast in a Normandy-style pairing of apples and cream.

5004705~Zuppa di Cavolo Nero, Cannellini, e Salsicce: Kale, White Bean, and Sausage Soup~2534~211~16~138~125~14817~247~Kale goes by another name, one much more dashing, especially in Italian. Cavolo Nero, black cabbage, may not evoke superhero status, but it's close. Kale does seem invincible and it's known to make the eater more so, too. It's also called dinosaur kale (also called lacinato), maybe because its leaves look like the back of a lizard. Those thin knobby leaves squeak. Do not confuse cavolo, accent on the first syllable, with cavallo, accent on the second, or you'll be ordering black horse, and in certain parts of the world will find it. Hearty and good for the spirit. I like soaked and cooked cannellini better than canned ones.
5004706~Ginger-Lime-Infused Simple Syrup~917~246~236~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5013574~Chilli Oil~234~39~0~3~0~167~0~Editor's Note: Use this oil to make Neven Maguire's Sweet Potato and Coconut Soup .
5004708~Corn Bread, Green Chili and Pine Nut Stuffing~3127~309~177~54~204~2124~559~"Michael McLaughlin, cookbook author, says, ""Not all Thanksgiving traditions originated decades ago. This recent addition to my holiday menu lineup was inspired by my move to Santa Fe. With locally grown green chilies readily available and pine nuts growing on piñon trees right outside my back door, a southwestern-style stuffing incorporating both ingredients seemed a natural. The tequila-soaked raisins are a sweet surprise."""
5004709~Lamb with White Poppy Seeds~1094~76~34~4~80~4154~224~Posto, cardamom pods, and whole dried red chiles are available at Penzeys (800-741-7787; penzeys.com) and Kalustyan's (800-352-3451; kalustyans.com).
5004710~Pork with Gorgonzola Sauce~2008~27~0~51~161~5708~598~"""On a visit to Key West, Florida, I had a superb dinner at Camille's Restaurant,"" writes Patrick Wessels of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. ""I was especially impressed by the creamy Gorgonzola cheese sauce they served over roast pork tenderloin."""
5004711~Steamed Fingerling Potatoes in White Wine~5030~1008~201~100~52~30263~0~Fingerlings have a particularly earthy quality that tastes of the essence of potato. Steaming them, rather than boiling, preserves their delicate shape and prevents them from becoming waterlogged, so that the simple dressing really comes through.
5010495~Crudites and Grilled Sausage with Sweet and Hot Chutneys~4004~32~32~176~336~13143~803~Highly recommended!

5004715~Persian Rice Salad~6066~771~256~138~279~20580~0~Nuts, lemon juice, and fresh herbs punch up this terrific side dish.
5008021~Kalbi~3995~581~254~36~145~1816~363~"Also known as Korean-style or cross-cut short ribs. We fell in love with this bone-in cut at Korean BBQ joints and are therefore partial to its Korean name (and flavor possibilities). Buy 2 pounds of cross-cut short ribs, each sliced lengthwise about 1/3"" thick."
5004717~Eggplant with Bacon Miso~1117~43~27~36~85~1965~125~Serve this rich, glazed eggplant as a starter, or with rice and a simply prepared piece of fish for a main course.

5004720~Cleansing Ginger-Chicken Soup~461~47~6~0~3~994~0~Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and can also calm an upset stomach. We love the heat it adds to this soup.
5004721~Potato, Carrot, and Zucchini Kugel~516~59~37~22~24~5344~414~Kugel is most often made with potatoes or noodles. Here, carrots, zucchini, and two kinds of onions add color and flavor to a potato version.
5004723~Coconut Cream Tartlets~1452~197~64~38~50~1358~500~Highly recommended!
5004724~Spiced Lamb Meatballs With Walnut Romesco~2562~253~144~132~128~10311~371~The smoky sauce and mix of spices in this meatball recipe complement lamb perfectly. It would be great with ground beef too, if that’s more your thing.
5004725~Warm Lentil Salad with Sausage~2054~304~15~135~32~4072~64~This bistro classic is enriched by rounds of smoky, spicy sausage. All you need is a leafy salad and a glass of red wine. The French green lentils that we prefer are prized for their finesse; they also hold their shape better than some other varieties and are less starchy.
5004726~Pepper Jelly Glazed Chicken with Corn and Zucchini~3070~310~163~138~140~7388~725~Highly recommended!

5004729~Pasta-Shell Risotto with Broccoli Rabe~1354~53~11~48~103~5569~136~Slowly cooking the pasta risotto-style by ladling hot broth over it allows the shells to soak up all of the broth's aroma and results in a velvety, creamy texture. The bitter bite of the greens adds just enough edge.
5004730~Harvey Wallbanger~614~141~135~5~2~500~1~Highly recommended!
5004731~Halibut on Mashed Fava Beans with Mint~2347~219~10~73~131~7295~0~Peeling spring's fleeting fresh fava beans takes some time, but the results are well worth the effort. You can blanch and peel the beans a day ahead.
5004732~Pizza Bianca with Prosciutto, Arugula, and Parmesan~800~16~11~39~65~1780~89~"Called bianca, or ""white,"" because they are sauceless, these crispy pizzas are the essence of clean flavor. The toppings are added after the crusts come out of the oven, melting the cheese slightly. This recipe makes two round pizzas or four rectangular ones."
5010229~Marinated Vegetable Salad~1134~112~44~80~40~2883~97~Marinating the vegetables overnight gives this fresh salad terrific flavor.
5004734~Artichokes with Romano, Cracked Pepper and Olive~2204~18~3~73~218~6340~177~The olive oil-and-cheese dressing is a nice alternative to drawn butter.
5004735~Polenta Tamale Pie~3358~88~34~206~239~6696~790~Tamale pie, made with a cornmeal-mush crust, dates back to 1911. In this recipe, we use ready-made polenta packaged in a roll. The spicy beef filling takes advantage of the excellent bottled salsas and canned refried beans now crowding market shelves.
5004736~Perfect Fish Tacos~1217~300~0~59~0~3929~0~Highly recommended!
5004737~Vanilla-Scented Pear Strudel with Hazelnuts and Chocolate Sauce~6635~717~479~46~387~930~680~Highly recommended!
5004738~Deviled Drumsticks~1162~138~8~36~50~1500~143~Scalloped potatoes, steamed broccoli, and sliced tomatoes with blue cheese dressing go well with these drumsticks. We like lemon meringue pie for dessert.

5004740~Pigs in Sleeping Bags~1192~87~10~56~58~2991~160~A handmade sausage mix takes the place of cocktail franks in this new party classic. A couple of these will keep those Manhattans you're swilling in check.
5004741~Braised Baby Onions with Orange Juice and Balsamic Vinegar~2038~247~157~13~111~7402~0~The sweet sharpness of both the orange juice and the balsamic vinegar combines with the natural sugars in the onions to create a delicious snack that's perfect to serve with cocktails, as an addition to an antipasto assortment, or as an accompaniment to roasted meats.

5004755~White Chocolate Pumpkin Mousse~1451~145~108~0~105~1215~314~White chocolate adds a rich, creamy sweetness to this quick pumpkin mousse. Be careful to keep the white chocolate and pumpkin mixtures warm as you mix them; otherwise, the white chocolate can set as it mixes into the pumpkin. If this happens, simply return the mixture to the microwave and gently reheat. Serve it alone or as part of our Build-Your-Own Thanksgiving Pie Bar.
5007545~Plantain Chips~9562~326~0~12~958~0~0~For an elegant change of pace from store-bought tortilla chips, fry thin slices of plantain at home. When slipped into hot oil, the plantains curve into beautiful, long strips. Delicately flavored and impossibly crisp, these chips are great for dipping in guacamole.
5004757~Gialina's Kale & Farro Salad with Avocado~3417~83~19~8~347~2978~0~Our neighborhood pizzeria, Gialina, gets high marks for its thin-crust pies and the impeccable produce that chef-owner Sharon Ardiana uses in her toppings and sides. Her salads are always irresistible, and this one is not only delicious, it also uses whole kale leaves, including the stems. Ardiana tosses chopped raw kale with bright rounds of sweet carrots, creamy avocado, and a handful of nutty farro for sweetness and texture, and then adds a garlic dressing that is reminiscent of green goddess dressing but without the mayonnaise.
5004758~Arugula and Radicchio with Feta and Dates~1663~107~79~6~133~648~0~Wishy-washy greens needn't apply: A gorgeously balanced symphony of peppery and bitter greens, cut with a lemony vinaigrette that makes the feta go creamy, and an occasional pop of sticky, sweet date, this is sure to become your go-to salad all summer long.

5004764~Bubby's Granola~9093~1195~451~175~447~0~0~This homemade cereal is hearty, wholesome, and filled with nutritious ingredients such as walnuts, rolled oats, raisins, and sunflower seeds. Granola is very flexible, so you can add whatever fruits and nuts are your personal favorites. This granola is great with milk or yogurt, or even as a topping on pancakes. Because raisins can make the granola soggy, we add them right before serving. The granola keeps well for a long time, so this is a big batch—it makes three pounds. Just keep it in an airtight container and eat it for breakfast all week, as we do at Bubby's or cut it in half to feed a smaller crowd.
5004766~Potato Salad with Olives, Tomatoes, and Capers~5004~845~171~96~99~25600~370~A popular salad on the island of Pantelleria.

5004776~Paprika Veal Shanks~2104~27~12~11~193~5752~0~Tender veal shanks get great depth of flavor from lecsó, a kind of Hungarian sofrito of sautéed onions, frying peppers, and tomatoes, to which paprika and, in this case, stock are added. (Grimes found that Cubanelle peppers are the best substitute for the long, yellowish-green peppers found throughout Hungary.) Finished with sour cream, the sauce yields more than you need, but you'll be happy to have leftovers to serve over noodles, chicken, or pork.
5004777~Lamb Broth with Cucumber & Mint Yogurt~379~66~21~27~11~40774~84~Cooked gently over a low heat, lamb shank becomes meltingly tender—perfect for an elegant, restorative broth.

5004913~Salmon Steaks with Red-Wine Butter~2320~126~105~71~164~5140~424~Unlike salmon fillets, salmon steaks have bones in the center. Any leftover red-wine butter is delicious on beef, lamb chops, chicken, or mushrooms.
5004914~Black Bean and Bell Pepper Salad~1814~220~86~25~93~2192~0~Black beans teamed with the red, yellow and green bell peppers provide an interesting contrast in color and texture.
5004915~Plum-Glazed Roast Turkey with Spinach, Bacon, and Cashew Stuffing and Plum Gravy~1419~41~0~60~107~5369~319~We think all turkeys are improved by brining (soaking in salt water), but it's a cumbersome task that few holiday schedules can accommodate. We find kosher turkeys, which are salted during the koshering process, to be just as flavorful and succulent as brined ones, without all the fuss.
5004917~Roast Beef, Red Pepper, Spinach, and Feta Sandwiches with Tahini Dressing~2100~193~38~91~108~4374~156~Serve with minted iced tea and tabbouleh, then offer baklava and cherries for dessert.

""We dined on the front porch of a Victorian house surrounded by tropical flowers. The chocolate cake we had that evening was just incredible. Would chef and owner Ray Johnson part with his recipe?"""
5004921~Artichokes Braised with Garlic and Thyme~808~43~0~3~68~2034~0~"Food editor Maggie Ruggiero learned this method of cooking artichokes from a close friend of hers, Betty Alfenito, ""prop stylist and cook extraordinaire."" We love the wonderful pan sauce it yields, as well as the way it infuses the artichokes with a subtle hint of garlic."
5004922~Nectarines, Plums, and Blueberries in Lemony Ginger Anise Syrup~996~189~158~2~30~800~0~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5004923~French Toast BLT with Roasted Garlic Vinaigrette~5776~105~40~251~479~6026~1640~"This combination of two all-time favorites is based on our New Orleans—style egg-soaked-and-fried pain perdu, or ""lost bread,"" a traditional method used to reclaim bread that was growing stale. I use fresh challah—thickly sliced or it will fall apart during the soak—because it has a rich sweetness but airy texture from being kneaded. The long soak creates a custard that cooks into the bread so it puffs up in the oven after getting a crisp crust in the frying pan. That's your base, topped with the saltiness and smokiness of bacon with a good cure, ripe tomato, and peppery arugula."
5004924~Poached Pineapple in Cinnamon Syrup with Yogurt Cheese~542~119~105~9~2~156~9~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5004927~Bulgur Salad with Chickpeas, Roasted Peppers, and Spiced Cumin Dressing~891~84~15~14~57~882~0~"Fine-grain bulgur, sometimes labeled ""good for tabbouleh,"" is essential to this recipe, because coarsely ground bulgur will not soften when soaked in boiling water. A late-season tomato salad or sautéed cherry tomatoes with Indian flavors complete this meal."
5004928~The Tomboy Cake~6468~933~652~209~309~6806~913~Inspired by a style of cake from California's Miette bakeries, we frost the top and middle layers of this stunner but leave the sides naked to showcase the almond cake. Don't have a pastry bag or star tip to frost the layers? Fill a resealable plastic bag with the frosting, snip off a corner, and pipe away.

5004938~Tomato and Bacon Clam Chowder~1217~122~23~37~57~4595~115~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5004939~Root Beer Baked Beans~1612~167~105~56~66~5622~122~For the best flavor, use an artisanal root beer made with cane sugar (not corn syrup). We like Faygo and Fitz's, but many more options are available online at sodapopstop.com.
5004940~Caramel-Apple Tartlets with Cinnamon-Rum Ice Cream~5045~719~281~52~206~1668~606~This tartlet is complex, but well worth the effort. It sprang from the mind of our bakery's apple-obsessed chef, Eric Wolitzky (he is from the apple heartland of upstate New York), who was attempting to wring more flavor from the traditional apple pie. Were still huge fans of the classic, but this version—with its perfect ratio of caramel to apple to buttery crust and crunchy topping—is now our must have apple dessert. At the bakery, we put the tartlets out at noon, and they are gone by 12:30 p.m., so we feel fairly confident that people share our new obsession.
5004941~Spicy Confit Chiles~167~33~0~0~0~1938~0~Chop these Calabrian-style chiles into pasta sauce or sprinkle onto pizza.
5017528~Couscous with Garbanzo Beans and Golden Raisins~1823~271~102~36~63~1044~0~Couscous is easy to cook—just add it to boiling water, remove it from the heat, and let it stand for a few minutes until the water is absorbed. The addition of cinnamon, lemon peel, garbanzo beans and golden raisins gives this side dish a Mediterranean flair.

5014683~Fresh Ricotta Cheese~1763~225~209~63~63~3832~227~"Surprisingly, it takes half a gallon of milk to get 1 1/2 cups of fresh ricotta. You'll need a double batch to have enough for the <epi:recipelink id=""351042"">gnocchi</epi:recipelink>. For the moistest, lightest consistency, let the curds drain only aslong as specified."

Then stop by Caseus, a cheese shop/bistro combo. The place is named for drained, pressed milk curds—and the folks here do know their cheese. The shop carries more than 100 artisanal varieties, which show up on the bistro menu. In this recipe, goat cheese adds wonderful flavor and texture to spicy hush puppies.

5007456~Marshmallow Frosting~391~91~90~9~0~195~4~This marshmallow frosting recipe was inspired by one of my favorite cookbook authors, the late Elaine Gottschall. It works especially well with S'mores and is divine frosted over Chocolate Cake or sandwiched between Chewy Chocolate Cookies. Don't fear if the mixture overcooks and the agave nectar turns dark amber—you will have roasted marshmallow frosting, creating a slightly different, though equally tasty, treat.

5005001~Pancakes with Warm Maple Syrup & Coffee Butter~1997~138~80~51~140~2387~741~If I entered a competitive-eating contest, it'd be one for pancakes. I like mine crispy edged, yet soft and tender inside. After years of tinkering, I've found that the best way to get this texture is to start with a fresh pancake batter, but you don't even have to make it yourself. (I love the buttermilk-based Robby's pancake mix available at RobbysPancakeMix.com or Amazon.) If you can, let the batter sit overnight in the refrigerator to hydrate and swell—that extra time makes for the fluffiest pancakes, I promise you. I love the play of the sweet maple syrup with the creamy, slightly bitter nature of the coffee butter in this recipe.

5005043~Strip Steak with Japanese Dipping Sauce~337~23~19~18~14~5202~54~To give steaks a boost, Myers makes an herb rub (he likes to dry the herbs himself; if you don't have a microwave, sub in 1 teaspoon of each dried herb) and pairs the meat with a tart ponzu sauce (ponzu is available at Asian markets and some supermarkets).

5005049~Coconut Tapioca With Pineapple, Mango, And Lime~511~74~66~0~0~484~0~Creamy coconut tapioca pudding with glazed pineapple is one of the desserts I obsessed over when I lived in New York City and worked for François Payard. All of the cooks at Payard Patisserie spent our free time talking about the places we dreamed of going and the dishes we couldn't wait to try. One of the cooks told me about how Claudia Fleming, at the time the pastry chef at Gramercy Tavern, had created a dreamy tapioca that could not be missed. He was right—on one of my last nights in NYC, I was finally able to try it, and thereafter every time I went to visit NYC, I made a point of going back to order it again. Sadly, it's no longer on the menu, but I've channeled it here in this version. It's light and refreshing and uses the natural sugars of mango, pineapple, and apple juice to complement the richness of the coconut milk.

5005056~Cauliflower and Leek Risotto~1867~274~12~52~54~4969~147~It's worth seeking out Carnaroli rice (from the Piedmont region of Italy) for this recipe: Carnaroli has a higher starch content than Arborio, so it makes a much creamier risotto. Chef Kiffin serves this with braised oxtails and a watercress salad.

5005070~Grilled Mahi-Mahi Tacos~1247~189~100~26~33~4035~126~A California classic, these tacos rely on quality fish—and a boost from a dry rub—to set them apart. Buy the best seafood you can find, and serve the extra pico de gallo with chips.

My family recipe is simple, made with readily available ingredients. It's a great blank canvas for adding all sorts of leftover proteins. I have made the dish with shredded roast chicken and duck, as well as sliced pork and beef. Sesame paste, often referred to as tahini, can be found in health food stores or the international foods aisle of your supermarket. If you can't find it, try unsalted 100 percent pure peanut or almond butter, which will give you different, but equally tasty, results.
5005136~Semolina Cake With Oranges~3894~547~288~69~159~2333~456~The semolina bakes into a crunchy layer on the top and bottom but stays moist and delicate within.

Mixing the pasta dough is a breeze in the food processor, but if you don't have one, don't worry — we've given the method for making the dough by hand as well. A brown-butter pine-nut sauce is light enough to let your efforts on the pasta really shine through.

5018231~Griddled Tomato-Chipotle Salsa~534~63~20~2~27~4593~0~This is another wonderful all-purpose salsa. It goes particularly well with eggs and any dish containing black beans. The essential technique in this recipe is the blackening of the tomatoes. That and the chipotle chile give the salsa its deep, smoky flavor.
5012829~Strawberry Cheesecake Milkshake~2930~244~206~42~190~1253~650~"What could possibly be better than a strawberry milkshake? A strawberry cheesecake milkshake! The cream cheese, which has a tang of its own that's enhanced by the lemon zest, helps make this milkshake as thick as, well, concrete (the very apt Missouri term for a milkshake).
If the idea of frozen strawberries hits you as totally counter to your locavore sensibilities, know that they are another secret to a milkshake thick enough to eat with a spoon, and if you grow your own or buy them at the farmers' market, we urge you to freeze them for this shake. You'll find the directions in the Cooks' Notes at the end of the recipe."

About forty minutes north of Santa Fe, the highway cuts a paved path through Ohkay Owingeh, a Native American reservation, and the roadside becomes dense with fast-food outlets, outposts of national grocery chains, Walmart, and billboards for Ohkay Casino, Hutch and Norma Naranjo's sprawling midcentury home is set about fifty years back from the road, a shrine to the tug-of-war between new ways and traditional ones. In the backyward Mr. Naranjo built two hornos (behive-shaped adobe ovens). Inside the house, a handmade wreath of dried chiles hangs on one wall and a string of made-for-tourists ceramic peppers on another. A naïve painting of St. Francis hangs not far from a cluster of the dream catchers that the couple and their two grown children fashion from string, feathers, and yarn, just as their Pueblo ancestors did.

5005169~Confetti Rice with Baked Tofu and Green Onion Omelet Strips~2986~622~15~68~14~2742~4~Cook and refrigerate the rice ahead of time. This meal needs only a bottle of Chardonnay.

5005171~Grilled Steak with Parsley-Parmesan Salad~564~2~1~17~55~430~45~The rich and beefy flatiron is also known as a top blade steak, but you can use any cut.
5005172~Roasted Potatoes with Sour Cream and Bacon~689~17~0~32~53~2916~115~"Since these potatoes are ""hasslebacked,"" or sliced accordion-style, before baking, the scallions and bacon fat really penetrate; the sour cream and bacon are the icing on the cake. (The dish has been known to elicit marriage proposals from strangers and tears from bacon lovers.)"
5005173~White Bean, Sun-dried Tomato, and Feta Bites~1533~96~9~33~116~2027~87~The white bean, sun-dried tomato, and Feta mixture can be prepared up to six hours in advance, but it's best to toast the bread at the last minute.

5005186~Rosemary and Cranberry Soda Bread~38~9~9~0~0~39333~0~This is an interesting twist on our beautiful soda bread.

5005188~Pasta with Creamy Wild Mushroom Sauce~1310~168~31~35~45~2500~172~Look for dried wild mushrooms at most supermarkets; they lend a wonderful richness to this dish, which is great with garlic bread.

5015735~Candied Orange Zest~936~248~244~0~0~1~0~You can sometimes find candied orange peel in stores, but it is typically thicker, chewier, and more moist than candied zest. It will also never have the intense citrusy flavor of candied zest you make yourself.

5011422~Spotted Dick~2873~481~186~142~119~6409~654~Steamed raisin pudding, or spotted dick, as it's also called, is a traditional English dessert cake that is steamed instead of baked. It can be portioned into 8 ramekins or steamed in a large bowl and turned out as a whole cake. If you're using the ramekins, rather than spooning in the batter, you may want to transfer it to a large pastry bag and pipe it in—this will keep things neat and produce evenly proportioned cakes.

5005203~Garden Greens and Goat Cheese Pasta~2076~398~0~35~35~44~0~This pasta is tasty made with kale, collards, or any greens you have growing in the garden. I will go and cut whatever is ready or use what I brought home from the farmers' market. I like to include something that has a bit of spice, such as broccoli rabe, red mustards, or mature rocket. Many times I will cook more greens than I need and put them in the refrigerator to make a quick pasta another time. (Add the garlic and goat cheese at the time you are going to toss them with the pasta.) This is perfect for those days when dinnertime shows up before you know it.
5005204~Watermelon-Honeydew Kebabs with Lime-Poppy Seed Dressing~1221~54~54~0~118~488~0~Most kids will like the dressing, but you might want to put it on the side just in case. Serve pink lemonade to the kids; the grown-ups might prefer iced tea or sangria.
5016746~Tacos of Carnitas Roasted with Orange, Milk, and Pepper~7544~117~115~789~458~35636~1986~Many years ago, I worked with a cook who introduced me to this method of roasting pork with milk and fresh orange. Jose has long since retired to his little pueblo in Michoacan, but his recipe lives on in my kitchen simply because it so delicious. Pork cooked this way is moist and succulent, sweet from the natural caramelization of the milk, with the slightest hint of orange and black pepper. For an over-the-top garnish, crumble chicharrón (fried pork skin) on the soft roast meat for a porky, crunchy textural contrast. Serve the carnitas with warm corn tortillas, avocado, a crisp raw tomatillo salsa, and plenty of onions and cilantro. If you have access to heirloom pork such as Kurobuta or Berkshire, it's exceptionally delicious—pork the way pork was meant to taste.

If you can't find sour cherries, use sweet cherries and a little extra lemon juice instead.

5005213~Green Juice with Baobab Powder~239~54~38~1~0~548~0~Okay, fine, you've never heard of baobab—but that's about to change. (Remember when no one knew how to pronounce quinoa?) You'll find the powder from the tangy superfruit stocked at the health food store.
5005214~Brisket Braised in Porter~3594~380~184~180~162~19696~620~The brisket tastes best if prepared ahead, so make it at least one day and up to two days before you plan to serve it. Chilling the brisket makes it easier to slice. Rewarm the meat in the sauce and serve with a full-flavored dark beer (see our suggestions below).
5005215~Buckwheat Crêpe Noodles with Chive Butter~2964~304~76~71~176~2787~827~"Buckwheat — which grows well in cold climates — has a solid place in French-Canadian cuisine. Buckwheat crêpes can be traced back to Brittany, and buckwheat pancakes are a regular part of a Canadian breakfast. These ""noodles,"" made from savory crêpes, are a contemporary twist on this classic dish."

5005227~Bacon Cheddar Quick Bread with Dried Pears~3007~396~54~110~95~4820~592~Cut the bread into cubes to offer with aperitifs, or serve it cut into strips with a salad. It tastes best the day it's made. The day after, try it toasted and topped with butter. For best texture, make sure the dried pears you use are plump and moist.
5005228~Chocolate Almond Sherry Cake with Caramelized Pears~2431~131~80~80~181~2496~475~This cake and custard sauce can also be made ahead. Both should come out of the refrigerator, to take the chill off, when the first course is served. The accompanying caramelized pears, which require not more than a few minutes to sauté, make a welcome addition to the cool custard sauce and moist cake.
5005229~Sausage and Egg Casserole with Sun-Dried Tomatoes and Mozzarella~4136~85~19~222~320~7259~1251~A satisfying, easy dish that's also versatile: Accompany with sliced melon and some assorted pastries for brunch, or with a green salad and warm focaccia for dinner.
5005230~Chocolate Pecan Dollars~3056~468~264~99~153~1324~394~These easy refrigerator cookies are great to have on hand. Chill or freeze the dough, then just slice some off and bake when you want cookies.
5005231~Nectarine-Raspberry Crisp with Spiced-Oatmeal Crumb Topping~3118~555~258~45~83~484~189~This vibrantly colored crisp is the perfect combination of sweet, tart, and spicy flavors.

5005262~Sweet Potato Pudding with Pecan and Gingersnap Topping~1847~227~200~32~94~1372~159~"The technique: Eggs change everything: The yolks add richness and texture, and folding in beaten egg whites elevates the sweet potato casserole to new heights.
The payoff: A sophisticated take on the classic marshmallow-topped sweet potato casserole."
5005263~Creamed Kale with Crispy Shallots~2075~290~94~83~75~2316~193~Let this be the dish to make a kale lover out of you. If you are a fan of creamed spinach, there is no way you won't fall head over heels for this dish. The same luscious flavors are all in play; the creamy sauce is spiked with onion, garlic, and a touch of nutmeg. Changing the leafy green from spinach to kale is a seemingly small substitute with a big impact. Like spinach, kale is packed with nutrients, but unlike spinach, it doesn't melt into the sauce; its texture is sturdier and retains its body when cooked. Crispy shallots bring another layer of texture along with their mild onion flavor.

5005274~Chicken with Cranberry-Mustard Sauce~1207~156~122~21~46~2202~171~"Doris Murphy of Pompano Beach, Florida, writes: ""When I was raising my children, the dishes I made were definitely home style to suit everyone's tastes; but even without the demands of feeding a family, I still prefer simpler recipes. Nevertheless, I notice that most of my kids are pretty adventurous cooks. Maybe they did get some of that creativity from me; when I recall the potato-meat-and-vegetable meals my mother served, I realize that I did branch out a bit."""
5005275~Asparagus and Prosciutto Bundles~427~8~6~29~30~1667~98~Slices of prosciutto spread with goat cheese and wrapped around asparagus tips make terrific cocktail party fare. The leftover asparagus stalks can be cut up and used in soup, or toss them with pasta, olive oil and Parmesan cheese.

Shiro miso— aided and abetted by mirin and lush mayonnaise—l asserts itself beautifully against the meaty tuna.

5005419~Grilled Whole Turkey~0~0~0~0~0~4846~0~This is best done on a large gas grill fitted with a thermometer — it's more labor-intensive to keep a charcoal grill at a constant high heat. You'll need a disposable roasting pan large enough to fit the turkey on a V-rack.
5010271~Mustard Dill Sauce~939~23~19~0~102~2565~157~This recipe was created to accompany Broiled Salmon Fillet with Mustard Dill Sauce Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5015424~Sweet Pastry Dough~877~30~29~9~78~679~218~With just a touch of sugar, this tender crust cradles the pastry cream and glazed-pear filling especially well.
5005427~Tuscan Kale with Sesame Oil~377~9~0~3~36~44~0~Sesame oil will become bitter if it gets too hot, so cook over gentle heat.
5013717~Ginger Cakes with Molten Chocolate Centers and Ginger Crème Anglaise~2489~337~224~59~133~1161~673~Make these little cakes using four 10-ounce mini-bundt pans (not non-stick). Ten-ounce ramekins would also work.

5012869~Smoked Whiskey Wings~416~46~42~18~16~101~76~You got your breast men and your leg men and your thigh men, but let me tell you something: I'm a wing man. What I love about wings is that you get a two-in-one treat when you eat them: Between the drumette and the flat, that's some good gnawing. Wings are great for weeknight cooking too, because they take very little time to prepare and cook.
5005432~Anise Cookie Baskets with Riesling Ice Cream and Fresh Fruit~3283~395~291~36~175~2154~512~Light cookies are filled with dessert-wine ice cream and fruit. The recipe makes about six cookies, so there's an allowance for breakage or extras for nibbling.
5005433~Rosemary-and-Pepper Standing Rib Roast with Two-Mushroom Pan Sauce~2520~125~29~102~167~32260~373~Standing rib roast is a special event; it's also surprisingly easy to make. This version gets a spice rub and a rich, earthy sauce that can be largely made ahead.
5005434~Sweet Potato Salad with Chili-Lime Dressing~3532~714~142~82~27~21151~10~This is a great summer salad, perfect with all kinds of barbecue and grilled foods. It's also a wonderful way to brighten up a winter dinner of broiled chicken or beef.
5005435~Quick Apple Tart~957~132~46~4~51~333~63~This dessert is as impressive as it is simple. And any number of variations would be equally tempting. Try using a mixture of apples and pears, substituting ground ginger for the cinnamon, or sprinkling the warm tart with finely chopped pecans.
5005436~Grilled Chicken with with Tamarind-Orange Glaze~3359~398~233~34~179~2491~234~Tamarind paste, from a pod with a sweet-tangy pulp, is common in Hawaiian cooking.
5005438~Golden Colcannon Pie~3944~698~140~83~78~20671~173~Colcannon, a classic Irish combination of mashed potatoes with cabbage or kale, is standard winter fare. If that sounds, well, boring, trust us, this version is anything but that. We freshen it up by cooking the potatoes and cabbage separately, then we make it easy to serve for a party by adding an egg and baking it in a pie pan, so that you can cut it into wedges.
5005439~Red Currant-Glazed Turkey with Sage and Red Currant Gravy~608~152~114~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5005440~Crunchy Wasabi-Crusted Fish with Red-Cabbage Slaw~1788~203~28~37~97~4821~143~Mild fillets get zing from a coating of wasabi mayonnaise.
5005441~Maple Syrup Candies~1575~417~417~0~0~56~0~If you crave the sweet maple candies sold at tourist shops, you need not wait until your next vacation to enjoy them. Maple syrup producers’ associations are eager to share these treats, and how to make them at home, to spread the gospel of pure maple syrup. This recipe is from the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers Association/Vermont Maple Promotion Board; the Massachusetts Maple Producers Association has produced a helpful video about making maple cream and maple candy. If you haven’t tried these maple candies, be forewarned: They’re like no other treat you’ve ever experienced.
5005442~Garlic Anchovy Artichoke Hearts~2671~274~48~47~150~1235~73~Artichokes are a rite of spring and essential to Easter in Italy where you will see this member of the thistle family piled high on market tables. Trimming the artichokes does take time, but they can be braised ahead and reheated. Garlic and lemon are a no-brainer with artichokes, while the anchovy is the secret weapon that adds a deep savoriness to the vegetable without any hint of fish.
5005443~Roasted Chicken with Garbanzo Ragoût and Gremolata~1790~90~48~60~126~5337~150~In this version of gremolata, garlic is omitted and rosemary and orange peel are added to the traditional mix of minced parsley and lemon peel.
5005444~Pesto From the Sea~462~41~5~5~27~68~0~This green pesto owes its intense and powerful flavor to the use of kombu. It’s such an easy recipe that you can experiment with the ingredients as much as you like. The arugula and basil, for instance, can be substituted with any leafy green of your choice. And the pine nuts can be replaced by any other type of nut, such as cashews or hazelnuts. You can even use sunflower seeds! Serve the pesto on crackers, on a grilled vegetable sandwich, or with a bowl of pasta.
5005445~Seafood and Fennel Soup~3818~577~113~135~91~21921~233~Complement this thick soup with plenty of crusty French bread.
5005446~"New England Blackberry ""Torte"""~1987~237~39~35~98~1011~585~"""I have prepared the plum torte from Marian Burros’s The Best of De Gustibus many times, and I’ve also tried variations using different kinds of fruit,"" says Peter Wayne Gagnon of Pineville, North Carolina. ""My experiments helped me arrive at my own version of this dessert."""
5005447~Slow-Roasted Chicken With All the Garlic~1580~72~3~0~140~800~0~Alliums, like green garlic bulbs, couldn’t be more at home in the oven, smothered in olive oil and seasoned with salt.

5006009~Moroccan Lamb Kebabs with Golden Couscous~2051~143~42~4~165~7837~0~Highly recommended!
5012015~Julia's and Jacques's Deglazing Sauce for Roast Chicken~114~1~0~0~11~2~31~"The juices from any roast—poultry or meat—caramelize in the pan, leaving a residue of brown glaze with intense flavor. In the process called ""deglazing,"" we melt these brown bits in hot liquid (wine, stock, and/or water), to create a quick sauce of concentrated natural essences. Make this pan sauce for either of our roast chickens."
5005457~Spinach, Feta, and Pine-Nut Phyllo Tart~2306~52~8~60~211~3591~610~In this recipe we call for a 10 1/2- by 7 1/2- by 1-inch rectangular tart pan. The tart could also be made using a baking sheet or a jelly-roll pan, as the filling is dense enough to hold its shape on its own.
5017939~Anise-Scented Fig and Date Swirls~3053~513~263~101~115~1482~330~Highly recommended!
5014912~Mutabal~1029~67~19~1~82~2129~0~Editor's note: Use this recipe to make Rawia Bishara's Eggplant Napoleon .
5005460~Coleslaw with Bay Shrimp and Tarragon~1684~133~89~95~90~2392~688~Thanks to the addition of some shrimp, coleslaw becomes a light main-course salad. Flaked cooked fish would also work nicely.
5005461~Veal Scaloppine with Mushroom Cream Sauce~1685~45~15~2~133~3101~314~At The Riviera restaurant in Dallas, this delicious main course is teamed with steamed asparagus and fingerling potatoes roasted with rosemary.
5005462~Mint-Chocolate Ice Cream Sandwich Cake~1908~3~3~3~225~656~729~Nothing beats the flavors of rich chocolate, refreshing peppermint, and luscious vanilla ice cream on a hot day. This pretty ice box cake comes together easily, thanks to prepared ice cream sandwiches and chocolate sauce, which also give it a stunning, retro look.
5017930~Cioppino~2854~186~19~129~158~6106~1133~This stew uses bottled clam juice, a smart shortcut to a robust broth.
5005464~Butter Lettuce Salad with Bacon, Dried Cherries, and Roquefort Vinaigrette~3183~102~80~75~278~5226~415~"""I return to Seattle's Cassis Bistro for the fine food and service,"" writes Eleanor O'Keefe of Seattle, Washington. ""In addition to the regular menu, there are always some fantastic seasonal specialties. I'd love to make one of their salads—it has dried cherries, bacon, and a blue-cheese vinaigrette."""
5005465~Turkey Enchiladas with Red Chili Sauce~3943~326~223~101~202~14039~333~Highly recommended!
5005466~Hanger Steak with Shallots~826~13~6~33~66~1582~168~"To my way of thinking, the traditional way of serving hanger steak is the best. The steaks are quickly pan-roasted—they're best served medium-rare (although in France they're often served ""bleu,"" so rare that they're almost blue and only just warm in the center)—and sauced with shallots that have been cooked to a compote's consistency with red wine and vinegar and then tossed with butter and herbs. Whether you sauce the steaks or not (sometimes small bistros in France will serve the steaks with just a spoonful of butter and some sea salt or a pot of strong mustard), I hope you'll serve them with the greatest and most classic accompaniment: pommes frites, French-fried potatoes."
5005467~Olive-Oil-Poached Salmon and Braised Artichokes with Sauvignon Blanc~19986~72~11~36~2276~5532~83~Highly recommended!
5005468~Lamb and Broccoli Stew~5979~444~324~219~366~85546~1105~Brining the lamb before it is slowly braised results in flavorful meat.
5005469~Manhattan-Style Seafood Stew~1217~17~6~120~56~4031~639~Highly recommended!
5005470~Salmon Wrapped Poached Eggs~680~13~7~12~68~1998~370~When poaching eggs for a crowd, we've found the baking pan method below to be almost foolproof. Have a friend help you wrap the eggs in salmon before they get cold. If you're working on your own, you may want to simply drape the salmon over the eggs.
5005725~Hazelnut-Cinnamon Biscotti~5666~826~218~113~196~2722~623~There will be plenty of leftover biscotti for afternoon coffee breaks.

5005473~Berry Compote with Crispy Won Ton Strips and Vanilla Ice Cream~2025~279~238~21~84~1083~302~This compote makes a lovely (and low-fat) dessert on its own, but the addition of ice cream and won ton strips makes it something special.
5005474~Grilled Butterflied Leg Of Lamb With Fresh Mint-Pepper Jelly~1169~110~3~15~62~2916~67~Butterflied lamb cooks faster and more evenly, and is easier to trim of fat and silverskin, than a whole leg of lamb. A butterflied leg has more surface area than a whole leg, so there's more flavor from the marinade and the grill. The lamb can be marinated up to 2 days in advance.
5005475~Fried Squid, Papaya, and Frisée Salad with Spicy-Sour Dressing~6900~1129~398~198~170~6725~183~Highly recommended!
5005476~Scandinavian Yellow Pea Soup~6014~419~82~346~374~13697~844~This is a fine dish for a cold day, and one that cries for ice-cold akvavit and beer. So popular is this soup with all the Nordics that it is said that the King of Sweden eats it every Thursday.
5005477~Caraway Cabbage Chips with Dill Yogurt~314~58~16~8~0~1224~9~Cabbage is my new favorite vegetable chip—especially sprinkled with toasted caraway and dipped in yogurt.
5005478~Sautéed Green Beans and Brussels Sprouts with Chile and Mint~743~82~23~27~41~217~0~Green beans and Brussels sprouts might seem like the Abbott and Costello of the vegetable world—lanky and straight versus roly-poly—but like so many odd couples, they go together beautifully. The key is to sautéthe vegetables so that they still have a little bite.
5005479~Roast Chicken with Maple-Soy Glaze~963~175~142~5~23~1439~63~Highly recommended!
5005480~Toast with Tomato-Butter and Marjoram~1296~81~10~10~98~1831~253~Compound butters are a great way to add flavor in a flash. Try your leftovers slathered on roasted vegetables or a seared steak.
5008529~Rib Eye Roast~110~16~7~6~2~304~7~Be sure to cook the beef just to rare or medium-rare. This way, the meat won't overcook or dry out when you use the leftovers in the other recipes.
5005483~Mussels with Shallots and Tarragon~499~20~9~14~29~1003~47~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5005484~Lemon Crème Brûlée Tart~2049~256~79~53~75~537~639~Highly recommended!
5005485~Wine-Braised Ham with Shallots and Carrots~2340~172~98~11~137~6214~377~This recipe makes the Easter favorite new again with a creamy Dijon-white wine sauce.
5005486~Meyer Lemon Budino~386~52~7~17~10~627~370~"Budino is Italian for ""pudding."""
5005487~Agave Margarita~249~68~62~0~0~0~0~This triple sec-free recipe was inspired by one from Tommy's Mexican Restaurant in San Francisco.

5005491~Blood Orange Roast Pork Loin~660~44~5~0~44~2011~0~Roasted fingerling potatoes would be great with this colorful dish. Ask the butcher to roll and tie the pork loin for you.
5016711~Rice with Soy-Glazed Bonito Flakes and Sesame Seeds~1802~381~1~35~14~1260~0~We love this recipe as much for the soy-glazed bonito flakes, with their maddeningly good smoky-savory-sweet flavor, as for making such great use of leftovers.
5009668~Pickled Napa Cabbage~206~39~2~16~0~5775~0~There is no dessert course in a traditional Japanese meal. Instead, pickles that refresh the palate are often the last thing eaten.
5005494~Quick-Pickled Carrots~991~217~193~5~7~12113~0~If you cut your carrots thin enough, you don't have to cook them to make great quick pickles; just pour hot pickling liquid directly over the carrots and let sit. For more visual punch, use multi-colored carrots.
5005495~Tagliatelle with Zucchini and Shrimp~1178~91~51~45~66~2122~298~Highly recommended!
5005497~Salmon Salad with Fennel, Orange, and Mint~1487~283~203~15~34~332~46~Highly recommended!
5005498~Lemon Pasta with Chicken and Pine Nuts~1847~81~39~99~127~3231~153~"""Gelson's market here in Los Angeles has a fantastic variety of prepared foods in the deli,"" says Susan Baker of Los Angeles, California. ""My mother, who doesn't have a Gelson's where she lives in Tacoma, would make a trip to Southern California just for their lemon chicken pasta. I'd love to surprise her with the recipe."""

5005505~Sauteed Chicken with Parsnip, Apple, and Sherry Pan Sauce~813~32~15~1~78~200~63~Highly recommended!
5005506~Linguine with Pears and Gorgonzola Cheese~3374~323~41~138~172~5576~579~Pears and Gorgonzola are a classic combination in Italy; here they team up in a unique pasta recipe. To make this intriguing dish even heartier, toss in some diced ham or cooked chicken.
5005507~Fresh Blackberry Napoleons with Cream Cheese Mousse~1968~307~264~9~83~808~168~"Joe Dion of North Charleston, South Carolina, writes: ""Because I work in a restaurant (I'm a chef at a place called Slightly North of Broad in Charleston), I don't let my cooking at home get too complicated. I'm at the restaurant five days a week and often work on weekends, but whenever I have the chance I enjoy getting together with friends and cooking for them."""

5005510~Fried Mozzarella Skewers~2502~147~39~128~151~4452~664~"Bastoncini di Mozzarella Fritta
This great, very tasty appetizer could also be turned into a vegetarian meal. The Italian title says it's ""Roman,"" and that is how it has been named on most Italian American menus, but mozzarella and anchovies are a well-known combination in southern Italy. There are mozzarella-and- anchovy fritters; and zucchini flowers are stuffed with mozzarella and anchovies, then fried. In this recipe, the mozzarella is fried between layers of bread, and then topped with a puckery sauce of lemon, capers, and anchovy."
5005512~Sauteed Mushrooms with Lemon Cream~2990~51~18~32~249~7127~882~Highly recommended!
5005513~Strawberry-Cucumber Salad with Lemon Cream~871~40~25~15~73~42~169~Strawberries and cream...and cardamom. The cooling spice and cucumbers give berries an element of intrigue.

5005515~Pineapple and Banana Couscous Pudding~1192~204~76~31~19~702~31~Couscous is a staple of the Moroccan table. This dessert version is similar to rice pudding. Cream of coconut adds extra flavor.

5005523~Grilled Korean-Style Short Ribs~1205~156~121~29~59~12617~0~In a Korean home or restaurant, grilled ribs (kalbi kui) would be accompanied by the spicy pickled cabbage called kimchi. It's available in the refrigerated foods section of some supermarkets and at Korean and Asian markets. For the ribs, have the butcher cut the flanken across the bones into 1/3- to 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Begin marinating the ribs one day ahead. What to drink: Asian lager.
5005524~Parmesan Bread Pudding with Broccoli Rabe and Pancetta~1809~194~41~65~79~7402~488~Use regular broccoli instead of broccoli rabe for a more kidfriendly version.
5005525~Frittata with Mustard Greens and Fontina~936~12~1~47~75~665~539~Hearty accompaniments would be grilled or broiled bell peppers and portobello mushrooms and a basket of crusty wheat rolls. In the Italian tradition, offer grapes, biscotti and espresso afterward.
5005526~Potato, Caramelized Onion, and Goat Cheese Gratin~2267~310~86~65~88~954~188~Highly recommended!
5005527~Whole-Wheat Scones~4853~818~417~214~106~5141~253~Here's a whole-grain update of that longtime British favorite, the scone. Serve it with hot tea at any time of the day or evening.

5005529~Citrus-Brined Pork Loin with Peach Mustard~1480~259~216~21~39~60882~58~The spice rub builds a nice flavorful crust around the pork as it cooks, but the sugar can cause the meat to brown quickly. Keep a close watch.
5005530~Vodka and Watermelon Cooler~733~160~160~2~6~336~4~Highly recommended!
5005531~Berry-Vodka Cooler~2065~743~109~6~0~24~0~Omit the alcohol for a kid-friendly drink.

5005534~Classic Mayonnaise~1603~2~0~9~165~1732~4~Homemade mayonnaise has a silkiness, an elegance, that you won't find in any commercial preparation. Making it by hand isn't hard (or time-consuming), but patience, constant whisking, and attention to detail are the keys to success.
5005535~Crispy Fried Shallots~4372~63~31~0~473~94~0~Crispy fried shallots are an essential condiment in Vietnam. They turn up in soups and on salads, sprinkled onto dumplings as a garnish, and minced and added to meatballs. Crispy, sweet, and salty, they are indispensible. You may want to make double batches, as people have a hard time resisting the urge to snack on them. Strain the oil you used to fry the shallots and use it in other recipes or to fry more shallots. The strained oil, called shallot oil, will keep, refrigerated, for several weeks. The shallots should be used the same day they are fried.
5005536~Blue Plate Special Meat Loaf~765~53~23~54~39~3571~105~Mashed potatoes and Green Beans with Warm Bacon Dressing (see recipe) are great side dishes. Follow with apple pie à la mode.
5005537~Coconut Rum Cake~3406~618~488~67~115~1563~667~Though the presentation of this cake— all white-glazed and topped with undulating ribbons of toasted coconut—will take everyone's breath away, we promise that it will only get better from there. (And the cake's rich, coconutty, rum-nipped flavor will never hint that it was a one-bowl effort.)
5005538~Twice-Baked Almond Cookies~6766~856~353~191~301~1768~370~Croquants d'Amandes
5005539~Grilled Chicken with Roasted Tomato and Oregano Salsa~868~78~26~22~47~3635~49~Enjoy generous portions of this low-calorie dish from Red Mountain Spa's executive chef Chad S. Luethje.

5005545~Frozen Raspberry Zabaglione on Meringues with Chocolate Sauce~3982~570~493~83~173~1474~41~Zabaglione is the Italian version of the foamy, custardy sauce known as sabayon in France. I found that freezing it for this dessert gave it a texture much like that of ice cream. For an extra-pretty presentation, garnish this with fresh raspberries, orange segments, mint leaves and additional sliced, toasted almonds.
5005546~Creamy Grits with Rosemary Bacon~1278~41~38~60~91~2196~240~Grits are often made with water, but the addition of whole milk—not to mention thick-cut bacon and fried eggs—turns a workhorse into a thoroughbred.
5005547~Beef Pasties with Caramelized Onions and Stilton Cheese~5026~549~88~177~210~6887~287~Pasties are savory turnovers. They originated in Cornwall, England, in the 1700s. During that era, tin miners took the portable pies into the mines for lunch.
5010319~Candied Walnuts~1779~76~39~33~152~987~0~Highly recommended!
5005549~Rib-Eye Steaks with Bell Peppers and Gorgonzola Butter~2099~147~5~55~163~2046~202~By mid-decade, indulgence foods were back with a vengeance-a sign that too much of a good-for-you thing was starting to get boring at the dinner table. And when the diet gurus switched their focus from complex carbohydrates to protein, steak regained some respect from nutrition buffs. Also, many specialty foods shops began catering to the most health-conscious meat eaters by offering beef raised without hormones.
5005550~Deviled Potato Salad~6274~1062~230~112~161~33625~559~Highly recommended!
5007336~Fresh Homemade Ricotta~2550~225~209~63~157~2941~541~When creative director Richard Ferretti came to Gourmet two and a half years ago, he brought along a recipe for homemade fresh ricotta. It is more delicate in flavor than any store-bought version and has a lovely dry curd. Some of us make it at home often because it takes just a few minutes of active time. Topped with honey and cinnamon, it's also great for dessert.
5005552~Three-Berry Pie with Vanilla Cream~2252~560~448~20~3~679~4~Active time: 40 minutes Start to finish: 6 hours(includes making dough and cooling pie)

5005564~Cajeta Flan~1866~276~255~40~69~825~669~The creamy, butterscotchy goat's-milk caramel called cajeta makes this flan delicate and earthy all at once. Whipped cream balances the sweetness.
5005565~Tossed Fresh Fruit Salad with Orange Mayonnaise Dressing~1887~196~137~5~126~2122~189~Highly recommended!
5005566~"Grilled Scallop ""Ceviche"""~2554~46~15~49~240~5788~377~Though it's not a true ceviche, since the scallops are already cooked when they hit the marinade, the classic combination of refreshing citrus acid from orange and lime juice, heat from jalapeño, crunch from cucumber, and sweetness from the scallops themselves becomes even more intriguing with the added layer of flavor from the grill. This is the perfect way to start off this menu, as the bold marinade stirs up the appetite for the substantial main course.
5005567~Five-Spice Roasted Guinea Hens~821~29~2~6~60~5736~0~Highly recommended!
5010090~Overnight Pizza Dough~3299~851~7~366~10~3877~0~"The dough gets its slightly tangy flavor from a ""sponge"" (a mixture of warm water, yeast, and flour thats allowed to ferment). Timing note: The sponge needs to rest overnight; the dough needs to rise for about eight hours."

5005573~Thai Tea Pudding with Lime Caramel and Candied Cashews~2540~341~279~46~107~2012~857~"On the streets of Thailand, where the temperature sometimes soars over 100°, there's nothing more refreshing than a plastic bag of Thai tea! Since most of the tea shops don't have seating, the Thai people take their sweetened iced tea ""to go"" in a plastic bag with a straw sticking out of it. The flavors of these teas were the inspiration for this dessert. The thing that makes this dish so special is the lime in the caramel, which adds an unusual tang to the sweetness. Another bonus is the crunch and spice of the cashews that are sprinkled over the top of the pudding, adding a wonderful surprise."
5005574~Pork Tenderloin Cubano~806~139~88~24~16~4831~58~This simplified version of a classic party dish will add some welcome heat to a winter night.
5013189~Farmhouse Herbed Stuffing~898~12~7~1~92~2208~253~The beauty of this American classic is its adaptability, as it can be almost endlessly enhanced. If you wish, use one of the variations below or experiment to create your own specialty.
5005576~Spaghetti with Cauliflower, Green Olives, and Almonds~4154~328~5~64~213~1511~0~Cauliflower, enhanced with toasty almonds and a briny parsley-olive mixture, holds its own as the star in this simple and slightly spicy vegetarian supper.

5005578~Baked Minty Rice with Feta and Pomegranate Relish~5875~577~21~54~295~2985~126~If you've given up on stovetop rice methods, you'll love this hands-off oven technique.
5005579~Brisket With Pomegranate-Walnut Sauce and Pistachio Gremolata~3716~465~280~39~183~4801~7~The combination of pomegranates and walnuts has been used in Persian cuisine for thousands of years, as both a sauce and marinade for meats. Here it is both. The tartness of the pomegranate brings brightness and balance to the rich brisket. Be sure to marinate the brisket at least 24 hours in advance.
5005580~Apple Fennel Granita~2567~660~554~0~0~1596~0~Highly recommended!
5005581~Fish and Chips with Malt Vinegar Mayonnaise~3936~324~0~183~279~7747~147~Key when making this batter: Be sure your beer and club soda are ice cold, and chill the batter if prepping ahead.
5005583~Pasta with Chickpeas and Charred Tomatoes~1709~234~7~24~40~591~0~Highly recommended!
5005584~Grilled Halloumi With Watermelon and Basil-Mint Oil~1795~90~54~27~142~1304~89~Firm, salty Halloumi is our favorite cheese for grilling. Find it in better supermarkets and at vineandtable.com.
5005585~Poached Chicken Breast Stuffed with Goat Cheese and Spinach~964~60~3~55~54~1912~129~This is a recipe that I cook at home myself — a versatile method for having a sophisticated meal on tap with very little last-minute prep work. This is a remarkable dish because it requires nothing but a pot of simmering water to cook it successfully; there is no butter, no oil, no sautéing, and no roasting. Yet the results are delicious. Here I've stuffed the chicken with goat cheese and spinach, but you can substitute Chopped Roasted Tomatoes ( this recipe can be found in the book), or any filling you like.
5014757~Garlic Rosemary Jelly~3382~828~828~0~0~2620~0~This recipe was created to accompany Crown Roast of Lamb .
5005587~Broccoli and Cheddar Skillet Flan~1409~71~54~42~105~5950~476~There are fluffy eggs, melting cheese, and golden hash browns in every bite of this one-dish meal. It makes a good stand-in for quiche, with potatoes acting as a crust.
5005588~Smoked Turkey and Blue Cheese Salad~1478~105~61~48~104~2518~131~Highly recommended!
5005589~Tuna and Vegetable Fettuccine with Lemon Breadcrumbs~7270~694~47~305~330~97334~1344~Both easy and inexpensive, tuna-noodle casserole stretched proteins and carbohydrates to the limits and fed at least a generation of American kids very well. Canned tuna will never go away, but fresh tuna has joined it as a culinary staple, and it stars in this deconstructed version of the classic. All the elements that make tuna casserole so appealing and comforting are here, just slightly rearranged. And there’s no need to serve this on a cafeteria tray: It’s good enough for your best china.
5005590~Basil-Arugula Pesto~2115~41~5~52~200~3261~118~Toss this delicious pesto with 1 1/2 pounds of your favorite pasta, or spread it on slices of Italian bread.
5005591~Penne with Basil-Seafood Sauce~2305~209~8~125~102~1795~770~If you're feeling extravagant, try replacing the scallops with half a pound of lobster. Or substitute a pound of cubed chicken for the seafood and chicken broth for the clam juice.
5005593~Tomato-Chipotle Soup with Fresh Peach Salsa~542~120~62~9~2~1788~0~Highly recommended!
5005594~Madeira Cream Gravy~847~106~48~20~51~1338~109~If you like fried chicken with cream gravy, you'll love this sauce —sophisticated and rich, with a bit of sweet fruitiness from the Madeira. It's a wonderful alternative to traditional pan gravy. You'll have to choose between this gravy or the cider sage version for the holiday meal, as you'll need the neck and giblets as well as the pan drippings for this recipe.
5005595~Swiss Chard Gratin~2044~234~17~29~108~2287~315~Active time: 1 1/4 hr Start to finish: 1 3/4 hr

5014598~Traditional Fish Stock~171~20~13~2~0~930~0~"This stock is even easier to put together than <epi:recipelink id=""105266"">Strong Fish Stockepi:recipelink. It does not require fish heads, only the bones of flat fish — sole, founder, halibut, or turbot — and it doesn’t call for the extra step of sweating the bones. It has a more delicate seafood flavor, and it is not as gelatinous as the Strong Fish Stock, making it very versatile. In addition to chowder and seafood stews like bouillabaisse, you can use this to make fish velouté and delicate French sauces such as Bercy (based on velouté and shallots) or bonnefemme.</epi:recipelink></epi:recipelink>"

5005615~Veal Chops with Sherry Gastrique and Roasted Peperonata~262~66~60~1~0~1124~0~A Sweet-sour peperonata (roasted peppers, garlic, and raisins) and a Sherry reduction balance the veal's richness.
5013916~Avocado Mayonnaise~675~15~0~3~68~912~79~This recipe was created to accompany Avocado Mayonnaise .
5005617~Vacherins with Raspberry Sorbet and Mixed Berry-Cardamom Sauce~4057~1036~1001~9~0~280~4~Begin at least a day before you plan to serve the vacherins. (Don't make them on a humid day; moisture prevents meringues from drying properly and staying crisp.) Use a 3 1/2-inch round cookie cutter or a 3 1/2-inch round can to trace the bases.
5005618~Lentil and Rice Salad~1377~214~14~23~49~2200~27~Tabbouleh is made with bulgur, but we decided to shake things up a bit by mixing tabbouleh flavors (parsley, tomato, and lemon) with rice and lentils, a common Middle Eastern pairing. Served chilled or at room temperature, the salad is terrific with any meat, poultry, or fish. You could add chickpeas, corn, or more lentils for a vegetarian main course.
5005619~Smoked Salmon Chowder~2927~293~73~162~93~98173~316~Simple to make and packed with omega-3s, this soup can be an easy weeknight supper or a sophisticated starter at a dinner party. Serve it with oyster crackers for the kids.
5005620~Tandoori-Spiced Chicken Breasts~459~53~13~22~9~3674~49~Tandoori chicken gets its name from the clay oven (heated by wood or coal) it is traditionally cooked in—a tandoor—which bakes meat, fish, poultry, and bread at temperatures upward of 500°F. In our version, the chicken is broiled and the signature yogurt and spice marinade contains only ingredients that are readily available on supermarket shelves.
5005621~Blue Cheese, Port, and Walnut Spread~4743~66~12~147~435~6174~618~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5005622~Paella Valenciana~5723~959~113~116~154~15684~62~This is the classic country paella of Valencia, made with chicken and rabbit, and in snail season, cooked snails called vaquetas. Authentic paella should be made over firewood. Twigs from olive or orange trees are used for hot flames, and thicker logs are used for a slower fire. The trick is to have both at the same time, so that the meat and vegetables can be browned slowly, then the rice brought to the boil over the hottest part of the fire, then set over a lower flame. If you can't build a wood fire, a charcoal one will do. Valencian bachoqueta de herradura and Valencian garrofón (special green and flat green beans, respectively, from the region) were called for in the original recipe, but other green beans can be substituted, and cooked dried beans or lima beans can be substituted for the flat green beans. You can also have your butcher cut up the rabbit for you, if desired.

5005626~Beef Shank and Sausage Ragù with Whole Grain Spaghetti~3890~267~89~285~186~7271~90~Beef Shank and Sausage Ragù with Whole Grain Spaghetti* As much as we love eating at old-school red-sauce joints, we're craving the updated regional Italian cuisine were seeing at restaurants across the country. In this dish, instead of marinara, we've got a rich, meaty ragù (a staple in Bologna) made with flavorful bone-in beef shanks and hot Italian sausage. Hearty whole grain pasta is the perfect vehicle for the sauce (and it's a great way to add nutritional value). The long-cooked sauce is the ideal thing to make on a lazy weekend and fills the house with delicious aromas.

5005628~Cucumber Avocado Soup~582~85~48~8~23~1018~27~This no-cook soup defeats the summer heat — cucumber provides crunch alongside a hint of minutest, and avocado adds mouthwatering creaminutesess.

5005631~Summer Chicken Sauté with Tomato-Basil Sauce~405~30~19~20~13~1251~45~Peperoncini, breadsticks, and orzo mixed with sliced oil-cured olives would round out the main course beautifully. End with raspberries and sweetened whipped cream.

5005640~Cream of Cope's Corn Soup with Shrimp and Wild Mushrooms~2626~33~12~80~245~3033~1431~What gives this thick, voluptuous soup its deep-golden flavor and aroma is toasted dried summer-sweet Cope's corn. Chef Linton Hopkins embellishes the soup with tender, briny shrimp and foresty mushrooms, but it would also be delicious with crabmeat or bacon & or with nothing at all to distract you from its mysterious, soul-satisfying essence.

5005654~Roasted Salmon with Cranberry-Mustard Sauce~402~3~1~0~41~714~0~"A terrific way to finish off the cranberry relish. Make full use of your oven — and your time — by roasting small red-skinned potatoes alongside the fish, then tossing the potatoes with butter and parsley to have as a side dish. Boil slim green beans or haricots verts to complement the main course. End the meal with slices of marble pound cake (""toasted"" briefly in the oven) topped with chocolate sauce and whipped cream."
5005655~Curried Beef Stew~5258~446~222~371~228~139308~769~All Thai curries start with a handful of aromatic ingredients (chiles, galangal, lemongrass, turmeric, etc.) pounded into a paste with a granite mortar and pestle. The paste is then stirred into soups or stews (often with coconut milk) or used as the basis of sautéed dishes. Use a mini-processor to make the curry paste if you'd like, although this incendiary stew will take on a deeper flavor if you use a granite mortar and pestle.

After I've spent all day baking — and tasting — sweets, it's good to go home and make ""real food"" to eat. Because I'm busy, I like dinnertime to be organized. My secret is keeping the pantry well stocked with basics like olive oil, kosher salt, and a variety of pastas and beans."""

5005792~Chicken and Couscous with a Punchy Relish~2253~211~18~73~121~8024~160~This is a mostly hands-off dinner that only needs a salad of assertive greens as accompaniment. The chicken gets a head start in the oven, but then finishes up by sharing its pan with the couscous. This way, the pasta laps up flavor from the meat, while getting crispy on top, and in turn, the steam coming up from the couscous keeps the chicken incredibly juicy. An intense slurry of anchovies, garlic, and lemon makes up most of the piquant dressing, with bursts of contrasting sweetness from the raisins.
5005793~Oven Fried Chicken~1126~36~20~28~88~2788~56~Highly recommended!

If the lamb has not been trimmed, cut off the outer layer of fat and about two inches of the fat between the bones (the bones will be exposed); this technique is called ""Frenching.""

From the time I was seven years old, my mom taught me how to cook and bake — salad, bread, vegetables, and dessert were pretty much part of every dinner. Even today, I make it a point to prepare and eat dinner with my two teenage children. Though we're very busy, we'll never abandon our dinner ritual. It's the time when we can talk and reconnect."""
5006765~Classic Turkey Stock~812~129~58~20~25~2299~0~To make the most of the turkey's giblets and neck, we first brown them to give the resulting stock (and later, gravy) depth of flavor.
5005830~Passion-Fruit Fool~2856~236~236~0~236~195~786~When my Scottish stepmother married my father, in 1963, she had a lot to learn about cooking. Once she made my father what she thought was a charming American variety of onion for dinner; they turned out to be bulbs of garlic. She's come a long way since then, providing our family with increasingly exotic taste memories influenced by years of living in Mexico and Brazil. The secret to a good fool, whatever the fruit, is to taste as you go. Some need more sugar; any fruit with little acidity benefits from a smidgen of lemon or lime juice; and more delicate flavors, like mango, require less cream.
5005831~Chocolate Chunk and Apricot Cannoli~1865~197~108~35~109~659~247~Most people think these Sicilian treats are available only in Italian bakeries. But here's delectable-and easy-proof that you can them at home. We've exchanged the usual addition of candied fruit for the more contemporary one of bittersweet chocolate and apricot preserves. Look for the cannoli shells at Italian markets.

5005835~Dates with Goat Cheese Wrapped in Prosciutto~298~71~65~2~0~9~0~These rich nibbles only taste decadent. Soft goat cheese is naturally lower in fat.
5005836~White Barbecue Sauce~1630~39~23~0~168~1738~253~There are many different styles of barbecue and more than one kind of barbecue sauce. This one originated in Alabama, and if you know what’s good for you, you’ll dip your fried chicken in it.  This recipe is from Buxton Hall, one of Bon Appétit's Hot 10, America's Best New Restaurants 2016.
5005837~Sauteed Striped Bass with Mint Pesto and Spiced Carrots~2087~153~63~30~150~1103~53~In this dish, the mint pesto says spring every bit as much as the carrots do.

5005849~Spiced Milk Tea (Masala Chai)~881~156~102~15~15~473~56~"Enjoyed by millions in India, masala chai, a spiced, sweetened black tea mixed with milk, is now popular around the world. It is sold all over India by chai wallahs, or tea vendors, who pour the tea from big kettles into small cups. Americans have incorrectly shortened the name to chai (which means simply ""milk tea""); masala refers to the combination of spices, which often includes cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, pepper, fennel, and star anise. Although there are many chai blends available in supermarkets, making your own is quick and satisfying, and the results are much better."
5005850~Spicy Tomato, Pepper, Cucumber, Mint, and Parsley Salad~1046~121~71~13~53~1647~27~This is the standard salad-relish you find in every tavern and restaurant in Istanbul. It accompanies grilled meat and especially kebabs. Turkish food is often eaten with a spoon, and so is this salad—all its ingredients are finely chopped. Instead of a simple lemon vinaigrette, which is the most common dressing, I like to add a little balsamic vinegar and lemon zest. Add as much jalapeño as you like, but bear in mind that this Turkish salsa is meant to be refreshing and not overpoweringly hot.

Be sure to get started at least three weeks ahead so that the flavors have time to meld. Any leftover liqueur would be terrific stirred into coffee or hot chocolate.
5005859~Three-Nut Pie with Cranberries~4734~685~539~62~204~1345~370~Tart cranberries provide delicious contrast to the rich nut filling.

5005865~Steak Skewers with Scallion Dipping Sauce~3291~118~23~250~184~22502~754~Pelaccio flips the kebab script by cubing luxurious cuts of steak and marinating them in coconut milk, garlic, and chiles. Try this with tri-tip, top sirloin cap steak, or rib eye; just make sure a strip of fat is still intact; you'll use it to thread onto the skewers.
5005866~Chicken Wings with Curry-Yogurt Glaze~2329~59~13~170~153~3338~690~Yogurt, curry, and cumin flavors combine in this delicious Indian-inspired appetizer. It makes terrific cocktail party fare.

Add a layer of salsa and Monterey Jack cheese for a Southwest flair; or replace the sausage and sun-dried tomatoes with some sautéed onions and Gruyère cheese for a French twist.
5005870~Sea Bass with Gingered Vegetable Stir-Fry~1252~55~27~34~91~7191~49~In this light yet intensely flavored dish, the fish is baked, then served with a sauce rich in Asian flavors. Offer with steamed white rice, and pour white wine or Champagne.
5018039~Warm Herbed Coriander Rice Salad~2331~310~69~28~112~598~44~If you think brown rice isn't for you, think again. In particular, think about brown basmati rice, whose slender grains offer an inviting combination of elegance and earthy chew. Now add in some chunks of zucchini, toasted pecans, lots of fresh herbs, and the mellowness of coriander (left over from Lamb Spice Rub ) and cumin, and you have a salad that's practically a meal.
5005872~Parsley-Potato Pancakes~1365~74~14~7~119~2222~0~These can be topped with caviar or smoked salmon for a special-occasion appetizer, but they are also good with fried eggs or as a side dish for grilled fish.

5005897~Smoked Salmon Tartare with Ginger and Sesame~337~10~3~26~20~557~77~In the early part of the decade, an appreciation of Asian flavors, a desire for spa-style cuisine, and the popularity of sushi dovetailed with the creation of this appetizer, usually prepared with raw salmon or tuna. The dish is now found on restaurant menus nationwide. This version, which calls for smoked salmon, features a wonderful combination of Pacific Rim flavors.

5007591~Homemade French Fries with Five Dipping Sauces~12904~1008~201~100~971~30263~0~The secret to great French fries is to fry them twice: once at a lower temperature to cook the potato through, then again at a higher temperature to brown them.

5005930~Zucchini with Raisins and Pine Nuts~925~95~46~6~51~578~47~The use of raisins and pine nuts in lightly sweet-and-sour sauces probably came to Sicily from Turkey; these ingredients also turn up in the cooking of Venice, long a commercial gateway to Turkey and the East, but less commonly in the anchovy-and-tomato sauces that are so fundamental to the Sicilian kitchen. Note that the zucchini in this dish is cooked rather soft, in the traditional Italian manner; if you want a more contemporary crisp product, add the zucchini toward the end for a quick cooking in the thickened sauce.

5005935~Smoked Turkey with Hot Pepper Jelly Glaze~978~230~225~9~1~521~34~Smoking a whole turkey is little more work than roasting a bird, but it infuses the meat with a rich, woodsy flavor. All it requires is setting up a grill. Once that's done, the turkey's good to go—all it needs is a simple glaze made from hot-pepper jelly. The final glaze caramelizes on the skin and adds a sweet and sour heat to the smoky turkey.

5005942~Peach Cobbler~1783~303~199~43~78~1509~214~This cobbler is wonderful after the chipotle-honey glazed pork (frankly, it's wonderful after anything).

5005950~Golden Beet Salad~804~63~29~19~48~2547~24~Salads need not focus on the lettuce. Here the greens take a back seat to vibrant golden beets. The salty, creamy blue cheese and the crunchy walnuts complement the sweet beets. Roasting the beets in water prevents them from drying out.

5005955~F is for Fruit Purees~147~35~17~0~0~941~0~Fruit makes a great puree and a thirst-quenching smoothie, and is just plain fun to pick up for toddlers. You can always serve fruit raw, but the flavor intensifies if you bake it. This recipe applies to any firm fruit, such as apples and pears, and stone fruit, such as peaches, pears, plums and apricots. The can be frozen, although nutrients will be lost.
5005956~Babas au Calvado with Glazed Apple Rings~1376~268~177~44~35~738~105~Highly recommended!
5005957~Tofu and Leek Stir-Fry with Ground Beef~355~22~8~14~20~889~7~Sichuan peppercorns are officially banned from import because they come from a plant that is susceptible to citrus canker. Although there's no substitute for their woodsy citrus flavor, the recipe is delicious without them.

5005961~Saltimbocca~1327~33~0~28~120~2127~89~(Veal Cutlets with Prosciutto and Sage)
5005962~Spice-Rubbed Cornish Hens with Haroseth Stuffing and Sherry Jus~522~9~9~0~55~0~0~Typically a ceremonial dish, haroseth becomes an inspired stuffing—dark and sweet—for Cornish hens seasoned seductively with allspice, cinnamon, cumin, and paprika. The tender meat and haroseth taste wonderful splashed with the rich jus (the Sherry is a nod to Spain), but we love the extra dimension added by the bright salsa verde, too.
5005963~Penne with Tomatoes, Olives and Capers~1828~319~3~50~38~932~60~Parmesan goes a long way on this meatless entrée, so use sparingly. Pour some Chianti.

5005967~Marinated Olives, Red Bell Pepper, Artichoke Hearts and Mushrooms~1255~42~8~10~121~2005~0~Outstanding in flavor and freshness, these marinated vegetables are unlike anything you'll find in a jar or deli case. But do make a trip to your local Italian delicatessen for sliced assorted cold cuts and crusty bread to go with the vegetables. It all adds up to an impressive no-hassle starter.

5005971~Venison with Mushroom-Wine Sauce~1647~158~6~176~31~6219~567~Earthy mushrooms, wine, and tomato bring out the best in this tender game meat. The mushrooms, with their meaty texture, round out the portion, so you get an extra-generous amount on your plate. If you can't get venison, pork tenderloin works well, too.

5005975~Grilled Pineapple Salsa~57~12~10~0~0~600~0~My aunt Martha swears that this smoky, sweet, tropical salsa takes her back to Yucatán no matter where she is when she makes it. It works especially well with Cilantro Tandoori Chicken, but it will enhance any grilled fish or meat. If the grill's fired up, throw the pineapple right on it; a grill pan will do just fine if you're cooking indoors.

5017672~Steamed White Rice~1608~372~0~30~0~0~0~No salt is used in this traditional Asian recipe. Folding the rice from the top to the bottom of the pan after cooking helps distribute moisture evenly.

5005981~Green Salad with Radishes and Creamy Mustard Dressing~1643~15~8~15~175~1506~370~Made creamy with sieved egg yolk, this dressing is also especially delicious when spooned over sliced beets or boiled and cooled asparagus, green beans, or cauliflower.
5015621~Rosemary Shortbread~1903~351~150~87~78~1720~214~Highly recommended!
5005983~Winter Squash with Spiced Butter~1670~183~93~16~92~7~253~Traditional Thanksgiving flavors (squash, cinnamon, butter) are given a beautiful Persian accent. The exotic spiced butter is also a treat mixed into couscous.
5005984~Southwestern Sweet Potato Sauté~817~31~16~19~70~1039~0~Talk about convenient! Baking a whole sweet potato takes about an hour, but sautéing the grated potato takes only fifteen minutes from start to finish — and you end up concentrating the flavor to boot. This recipe dresses up your potato with Southwestern ingredients, but there's no reason not to go Asian (add ginger and soy) or Italian (add sage, brown butter, and pine nuts) as the mood strikes you. For that matter, you could swap out the sweet potato and use butternut squash instead.
5005985~Avocado-Lime Soup with Chipotle Chile~701~163~43~30~41~3009~23~Yes, avocado is high in fat, but it's the good, monounsaturated kind that helps increase satiety so you feel full with fewer calories.

5005988~Golden Cake with Chocolate Sour Cream Frosting~6535~1151~489~130~158~5300~587~Watch everyone’s eyes open wide when you serve this big four-layer cake.
5005989~Italian Vegetable Salad with Creamy Garlic Dressing~1712~89~35~27~136~931~51~Consider this a reintroduction to some old standbys, because cauliflower, asparagus, and fennel taste utterly new with a mellow garlicky dressing. Food editor Kay Chun, who developed the recipe, prefers to use vegetable oil for its light, neutral flavor, which allows the garlic and the deep savor of anchovies to shine. Tossing the salad right before serving ensures that it retains its crunch.

5005993~Vidalia Onion Tart with Bacon, Local Honey, and Fresh Thyme~3585~358~52~173~246~5515~628~The official vegetable of Georgia since 1990, the sweet, mild Vidalia onion is recognized worldwide for its gentle flavor. However, Vidalias can only be grown in a 20-county production area in and around Vidalia, Georgia, to legally wear the Vidalia label. Because of their thin, tender skins and relatively high sugar content, Vidalia onions are more perishable than most and need to be consumed within about one week of purchase. Look for Georgia-grown Vidalias at farmers markets around the Southeast in early spring through the summer.
5005994~Apple and Dried Cherry Custard Bread Pudding~5921~710~487~53~308~1408~1190~White bread is perfect for bread pudding—as long as it's hand-formed and (preferably) unsliced, like the old-fashioned white here.
5005995~Smoky Tangy Greens And Beans~4695~482~182~133~228~4838~383~Cook the collards until they completely surrender themselves to the rich, spicy, lip-smacking braising liquid. This recipe is from Buxton Hall, one of Bon Appétit's Hot 10, America's Best New Restaurants 2016.

5006002~Wasabi and Green Onion Mashed Potatoes~6750~1034~208~107~224~31644~567~Japanese horseradish gives these a bit of heat. Great with steak or prime rib, too.

5006010~Chilled Avocado and Mint Soup~5011~186~147~109~188~5223~0~Fresh mint makes this starter all the more cooling. Use Haas avocados for the creamiest texture. What to drink: Throughout the meal, go with the classics — beer and Margaritas.

5006013~Roasted Onions With Vinegar~962~163~108~18~27~0~0~Elevating the humble onion: Roasting them in their skins retains their natural sugars, and they get meltingly soft without disintegrating.

First, the birds are spatchcocked, meaning they're butterflied and spread flat so that both the white meat and the dark can be perfectly cooked; second, an herbed-ricotta filling is pushed under the skin, puffing slightly during cooking and extending the meat's flavor in a creamy direction. Actually, you'll notice how much we liked the filling — we call for extra to be baked in a separate dish so that everyone gets a helping. The filling becomes a cross between a popover and a soufflé in texture, with oregano and parsley supplying a suggestion of the Provençal countryside.
5006039~Easy Provençal Lamb~4955~770~473~68~147~4068~0~My friend Myriam Richard-Delorme in Paris is a great cook and she gave me this recipe. All you do is put a leg of lamb in a roasting pan with lots of cut-up tomatoes, onions, garlic, rosemary—and then pour honey over it to caramelize the lamb and tomatoes while they roast. Everything cooks in one pan and a few hours later I have the most succulent roast lamb, plus the tomatoes and pan juices become the vegetable and the sauce. OMG is it fabulous!
5006040~Quinoa with Corn, Scallions, and Mint~3087~449~35~56~103~4415~229~Steamed quinoa has an unbelievably light and fluffy texture. If you can get fresh-picked corn, you can add it to the salad raw—even without cooking, the kernels will be sweet and tender.

The Parmesan is a must and not an option to switch out; it's the magic ingredient that will make the meat more savory and any cheese you stuff in your slider taste cheesier.
The recipe can be halved or doubled easily, so if there are a lot of kids in your crowd, you might want to cut back on the number you make. If a bunch of your drinking buddies are on their way over, however, you'll likely want to do 1 1/2 times the recipe, or even double it.
We've given you suggestions for toppers and meat-and-cheese combinations, but those are just ideas to get your imagination going. If the weather is cooperative, fire up your grill, but if you are grill-less, the broiler does a fine job. Any which way you do it, you can't help but have fun!"

5006163~Broiled Mackerel with Ginger and Garlic~204~9~0~0~14~3055~0~This mackerel, which pairs well with the fennel endive salad , was inspired by our trips to Southeast Asia, where dishes are commonly served with whole sprigs of fresh herbs for diners to pull off the leaves and eat as desired. Incidentally, this means less chopping for the cook. Also, to save time, we minced the ginger and garlic in a mini food processor.
5006165~Pear-Almond Tartlets~715~113~68~13~28~528~4~Highly recommended!
5006166~Salmon with Breadcrumb, Olive and Sun-Dried Tomato Crust~1396~201~8~33~31~1474~63~"""Dinner at the Montauk Seafood Grill was an ideal way to cap off a day of skiing in Vail,"" Julie Harris of Redwood City, California. ""The salmon covered with an unusual breadcrumb coating is something I would like to make for a dinner party."""
5006167~Asian Meatballs with Sesame Lime Dipping Sauce~1696~124~32~150~134~7346~360~Enlivened with crisp water chestnuts and fresh cilantro, these delicate Asian-inspired veal and pork meatballs are a world away from their Italian counterpart — but they're just as moist and irresistible.
5019162~Red-Cabbage Confit~2767~375~237~96~89~12020~210~"An accompaniment to <epi:recipelink id=""13198"">Spiced Venison Steaks</epi:recipelink>"

If you've never had a beer cocktail or, better yet, a cocktail made with drinking vinegars, let this be your introduction to two growing trends in the bar world. Look for Laird's Bonded Apple Brandy, a.k.a. applejack ($23), made by America's oldest family-owned distillery, at better liquor stores."

5006172~Farro Soup with Kale and Cannellini~1380~181~25~49~48~4855~59~Chewy nubbin of farro give special appeal to a hearty Mediterranean vegetable-bean soup that's loaded with calcium-rich kale. If you don't have time to cook the beans from scratch, check out the Express Farro and Chickpea Soup variation.
5016497~Braised Beef Short Ribs with Root Vegetable Ragoût~94~19~11~1~3~966~0~Highly recommended!
5006174~Cornbread with Caramelized Apples and Onions~3338~483~128~114~27~4568~370~"If you don't have (or can't spare) a cast-iron skillet, sauté the apples and onions in any heavy skillet and transfer to a buttered 8x8"" glass dish for baking."
5006176~Curried Greens with Golden Onions and Cashews~1500~49~15~23~141~1491~0~This recipe is very adaptable. You can use whatever quantities of mustard and dandelion greens and spinach you happen to have on hand—just keep the total amount of greens the same.

5006178~Butternut Squash Vegducken~5153~316~135~122~379~3328~1080~There's no shame in not eating turkey at Thanksgiving, or ham at Christmas—that is, when you have Butternut Squash Vegducken. This vegetable stunner of an entrée is an entirely meatless take on turducken, with butternut squash, eggplant, and zucchini filling in for the usual suspects. An added bonus: the cheesy mushroom stuffing makes use of leftover vegetable scraps, making the dish #wasteless
5006179~Avocado, Grapefruit, and Watercress Salad with Roquefort and Paprika Dressing~250~21~9~3~16~359~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5006180~Lemon Pistachio Biscotti~2900~514~224~149~111~1362~410~I have always loved the combination of lemon and pistachios. Maybe it's the idea of yellow and green or the fact that the acidity of lemon perfectly tempers the richness of pistachios. Be careful on the second baking of these biscotti — if they get a little too dark the pistachios will turn brown and you'll lose their lovely green color.
5006181~Braised Brussels Sprouts, Pearl Onions and Chestnuts~2007~345~96~49~50~705~126~Highly recommended!

5013691~Chocolate Syrup~177~26~0~8~8~0~0~Reminiscent of your favorite sundae sauce, but better! A sip of soda made from this deep, dark, intense brew is like chomping down on a chocolate bar.
5006192~Pasta with Sausage, Eggplant and Basil~6170~400~90~268~380~203640~735~This zippy pasta features the best of Italy accented with Mexican serrano chilies. A Zinfandel or Italian Barolo is the right wine.
5006193~Corn Biscuits with Bacon and Sage~4769~755~69~149~87~6957~489~Tender Iowa corn was the inspiration for these terrific biscuits. They are best eaten the day they are baked; extras can be warmed up the next morning for breakfast or brunch. Be sure to serve them with plenty of butter.
5006194~Pasta with Kalamata Olives and Roasted Cherry Tomato Sauce~2890~429~55~105~85~456140~119~Roasting the tomatoes concentrates their sweetness. What to drink: A dry Italian white, such as Pinot Grigio or Soave.
5010453~Easy Vegetable Stock~483~106~43~2~3~1081~0~It was a challenge for me to write a recipe for vegetable stock, because in truth, mine is different every time. I am inspired to make it whenever I am prepping lots of veggies, and I realize that what I have left over—the tops of four leeks, three parsnip stubs, carrot peels and tips, and a pile of parsley stems—is almost everything I need to make a great stock. When faced with the decision to capture these flavors so they can become the foundation for future delicious soups, stews, or beans, versus adding them to my compost pile, I try to choose the former. Once you experience how much better your recipes turn out with homemade stock (not to mention how much money you save and how many cartons you keep out of the trash), youll get more motivated. I usually keep a bag in the fridge where I save my veggie scraps, and when it gets big enough, I set my pot on the stove. The recipe below is simple and easy. You can also add corncobs, potato skins, mushroom bottoms, and even tomatoes. If you have a huge stockpot, as I do, you can easily double or triple this recipe. I keep as much stock in the refrigerator as I plan to use within 5 days and freeze the rest. —Myra

5006209~Shrimp, Chicken, and Andouille Gumbo~11594~286~47~964~692~23231~5824~A cook's dream: The base is made ahead, and the shrimp are added at the last minute. Best of all, the gumbo tastes even better the second day.
5006210~Sweet Potato and Roasted Mushroom Stuffing~8178~1579~245~213~97~30399~474~One of two stuffings (see also the Apple and Sausage Stuffing) developed by Barbara Shinn and David Page of Home restaurant in New York. This dish features large cubes of French bread and a custardy texture. To ensure a crisply browned top, the stuffing should be baked separately from the turkey.

5006216~Chicken, Walnut, and Red Grape Salad with Curry Dressing~686~82~63~6~42~875~65~Madras-style curry powder, which is spicier than the standard, adds a little heat here.

5008114~Perfect Steamed Rice~2413~553~0~42~0~141~0~If you don't have a rice cooker, this is the way to prepare absolutely perfect rice. The liquid cooks down before you cover the pot, so you have more control over how much liquid evaporates; this makes all the difference between mushy and fluffy rice.

5006225~Parsnip, Potato, and Turnip Puree~4070~536~80~145~133~97917~218~"The technique: Pureeing means to grind or mash food until smooth. Here, potatoes, parsnips, and turnips are whipped into a creamy side dish.
The payoff: A slightly sweeter, more modern take on mashed potatoes."
5006226~Garlicky Linguine with Crab, Red Bell Pepper and Pine Nuts~2410~311~17~108~76~3891~562~Parmesan isn't usually served with seafood pasta, but the cheese adds a nice richness to this linguine.

Pick your chard color here—the clean green Swiss or the sweet-shop-neon rainbow chard. It is not often that one vegetable provides such a bouquet of options. Black-eyed peas were often overlooked in my kitchen in favor of earthy black beans, buttery cannellini, or plump lima beans. No longer though; black-eyed peas are a new favorite. Sometimes, I like to top this with tahini for an extra layer of flavor.
5006248~Burnt Orange Panna Cotta~2195~181~166~12~167~448~474~Highly recommended!

5006253~Corn and Chicken Poblano Braised Chicken~1220~132~29~35~63~3046~125~There's no need to introduce any liquid to the slow cooker—as the chicken legs and vegetables cook, they release their juices to make a very savory stew. Whisking in some sour cream just before serving adds body to the sauce, and fresh cilantro brings brightness to this no–hassle one–dish dinner. Poblano chiles have notoriously tough skins, but we were happily surprised to learn that several hours of gentle cooking makes the skins practically melt away.
5006254~Portobello Buffalo Burgers with Celery Apple Slaw~1878~65~13~83~133~4647~314~More and more people are cooking with ground buffalo meat because it's lower in fat than beef chuck. That very asset can turn into a liability if the meat is cooked too long, so here, sautéed chopped portobello mushrooms contribute additional moistness and flavor. Don't reach for the ketchup: A crisp slaw of celery and apples in a mustardy dressing is a piquant surprise.
5006255~Rosemary Mint Wine Jelly~5556~1360~1175~0~0~2998~0~Highly recommended!

Tossing it with pumpkin-hued vegetables lusty with garlic and hot pepper might seem like hobgoblin overkill, except that the flavors work well together. Really well. So much so that you'll be making this pasta combination again and again, long after the jack-o-lanterns have disappeared.
5006257~Pumpkin Seed-Crusted Trout with Cabbage-Cilantro Salad~1190~132~30~42~43~2094~57~Highly recommended!

5017779~Strawberry Jam~2921~745~684~19~0~381~0~This recipe makes more than enough jam for Chef Ryan Hardy's buttermilk panna cotta . He recommends making the full amount—leftovers are delicious in peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
5006869~Pissaladiere~3600~522~93~73~124~4780~82~Lovely for lunch or with a salad for dinner.

5006268~Caramel-Dipped Popovers with Chocolate Mousse~4096~562~389~83~214~4826~892~These savory popovers are made with cheddar cheese, which keeps the dessert from veering into overly sweet territory.

5009404~"Salmon with Potato ""Scales"""~2386~17~0~202~169~2500~813~"When the opportunity arises—as it did with this salmon—we can't resist a little trompe l'oeil, a chance to have some harmless fun with our food, because, well, food is fun. And with Hanukkah being a particularly kid-friendly holiday, we know children and adults alike will get a big kick out of the edible potato ""scales"" that top these individual slabs of salmon. Your budding young chefs will love arranging the scales on the fish."
5006271~Egg, Onion, and Apple Croquettes~3507~588~117~104~78~4830~919~Highly recommended!
5006272~Maricel's Mojo~1550~134~95~4~113~1270~0~This garlicky sauce is the traditional accompaniment to the starchy root vegetables of the Hispanic Caribbean, especially Cuba. The acidic medium is usually Seville, or bitter, orange juice, though lime juice or white vinegar can be substituted. The mojo is at its best spooned or brushed over piping-hot boiled yuca, plantains, or other starchy tropical vegetables.
5006273~Raisin-Nut Spice Cookies~6798~799~439~128~347~2802~387~Sardinia, Italy
5006274~Red Bell Pepper, Raisin and Olive Stuffing~3057~312~219~28~214~5034~506~Sicilian cooking is hot right now, so we've taken some of its classic, assertive ingredients and put them into a hearty stuffing. It's something new for the turkey.

This drink demonstrates so ably how fresh ingredients can be incorporated into everyday drinking cocktails. Head to your kitchen garden or snag a big bunch of basil at the farmers’ market, and you’re mere steps from a living drink that will make your head dizzy. This drink smashes basil, but you can smash anything—tarragon, thyme, cilantro, or kefir lime leaves. Let this drink inspire you. We like to host a garden party with an assortment of fresh herbs and gins, and let friends muddle their way through an array of flavors."
5006280~Date Shake with Toasted Nuts (Majoon)~2123~549~82~26~39~785~4~I first tasted a majoon at the Café Glacé in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, where these decadent concoctions are whipped up with vanilla ice cream for Westwood's large Persian community. I make majoon with yogurt instead, which gives it a hint of lemony sourness and packs enough nutrients for a healthy breakfast. Although it takes more time, I recommend toasting nuts and seeds in the oven on a dry baking sheet, rather than in a pan on the stove top, because they cook more evenly. You can toast a few cups at a time and keep them on hand for various recipes. Toast the delicate coconut flakes, sesame seeds, and pistachios at 300°F for 3 to 4 minutes, then transfer immediately to a plate to prevent burning. Toast the almonds and walnuts at 350°F for about 12 minutes, until fragrant and crisp.

5006375~Spring Vegetable and Goat Cheese Dip~2122~270~56~75~89~3066~177~"Everything I know about getting a party started right, I learned at Houston's restaurant in Atlanta. No kidding. Its creamy, bubbling spinach and artichoke dip was a must on date night in high school, and these days it's the dish that even the snobbiest of food snobs can't resist. I'll whip it up for friends and, no matter what else I serve, it's always the first thing to go. Sometimes I leave out the spinach, add red pepper flakes, or use whatever vegetable is in season. In other words, it stands up to improvisation. We've put a spring spin on the dish, starring asparagus, just-dug-up leeks, sweet peas, and fresh goat cheese. Serve it with crostini, tortilla chips, or crudités. Or just eat it by the spoonful. It's that good.

5018715~To Crack and Shave Fresh Coconut~375~100~100~0~0~50~0~"Because coconuts can be difficult nuts to crack—especially for cooks new to the task—we offer a simple method that involves baking the coconut briefly. If the coconut doesn't crack while in the oven, it will once force is applied. The thin, clear liquid, or ""coconut water,"" can be used in soups or for cooking rice. You can also drink it as is."

""It was a memorable night with good friends, great food and lots of wine. That night, cooking became my passion.

5006412~London Broil with Soy Citrus Mayonnaise~2720~84~11~57~241~12868~368~London broil comes in different weights and thicknesses; it may be necessary to use two pieces to get the proper amount for this dish.

5006418~Black-Eyed Pea Chile Verde~1378~151~28~53~58~2656~64~Smoked pork hocks don’t just add meatiness and body; they release smoky, salty notes as they cook, seasoning the beans in the process.

5006425~Muscovy Duck Breasts with Pomegranate-Wine Sauce~2216~202~101~63~93~11049~165~Muscovy duck is the leanest of all domesticated duck breeds, yet tender and full-flavored. This technique makes it even leaner by first rendering the fat from the skin (which also makes it deliciously crisp). If you don't find Muscovy duck in stores, order it online from dartangnan.com or grimaud.com.
5016487~Pickled Cucumbers~236~60~53~1~0~969~0~This recipe was created to accompany Grilled Swedish Meatball Kebabs
5006429~Boulevardier~179~10~7~15~8~469~49~"""We age drinks that have a wine component, such as vermouth or Sherry, because the wine will oxidize a little bit. That brings out a lot of nutty, grassy, earthy flavors."" —Jeffrey Morgenthaler; Clyde Common, Portland, OR"
5006430~Crab Fat-Caramel Wings~5494~783~361~247~180~13589~756~Don't worry.you won't need to buy any crabs to make these mind-altering wings. The crab flavor comes from a jarred condiment that's pretty easy to find at Asian markets; if not, use the shrimp version.
5006432~Ham Steak with Bourbon-Cream Sauce~793~10~7~16~79~643~272~Food editor Ian Knauer has taken three of his favorite things—pigs, booze, and fire—and combined them into a heady, creamy, southern-inspired specialty.

5006447~Sour-Cherry Streusel Pie~7858~1619~1222~34~92~915~253~Look for fresh sour cherries at farmers' markets. Or use Bing cherries instead and add 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice to the filling.

5006454~Kashmiri Chai with Gin~866~112~104~19~25~473~56~This chai is a knockout on its own, but gin adds subtle flavors that complement the chai's complexity. (Needless to say, since Kashmir is predominantly Muslim, alcohol would not be added there.) Nuts in a cocktail seemed a little odd at first, and it's fine to strain them out before serving, but most of us found them addictive.
5006455~Golden Pear Chutney~10350~2422~1815~44~54~5471~0~Lowcountry cooking is full of ideas that seem foreign to outsiders. This sweet and spicy chutney is the perfect foil for salty country ham. Ground together, the two form a paste for memorable appetizers.

5016704~Artichoke Bruschetta~1025~55~10~5~88~1124~10~Though these bruschetta are a terrific first course for almost any meal. They'd actually make a great lunch as well—just think of them as open-faced sandwiches.

5006472~Herb Roasted Turkey~1203~25~13~7~118~5973~344~Thanksgiving is hands-down my favorite holiday. Bar Americain is open each year for Thanksgiving, and we typically serve about six hundred people before the day is over. No matter how many wonderful selections we offer on the abbreviated holiday menu, without fail turkey is the biggest seller—partly because people love it and partly, I think, out of a sense of tradition. This is the turkey that I serve at Bar Americain, with only the dressing and sides changing from year to year. This year I am pairing the all-American bird with all-American ingredients: wild mushrooms and Pinot Noir from the Pacific Northwest, figs from California, cranberries from Maine, bacon from Kentucky, and sweet potatoes from Georgia.
5006474~Radishes with Herbed Salt and Olive Oil~1277~163~64~32~56~4408~0~Start off a holiday meal in the freshest way possible: With crunchy radishes dipped in olive oil and then into flavorful herbed salt.

5006476~Wild Rice, Farro, and Tangerine Salad~1832~291~20~27~63~701~10~Both the wild rice and the farro can be cooked a day in advance; let them cool separately on baking sheets, then cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before dressing.

5006478~Shrimp Skewers with Tzatziki, Spinach, and Feta~1547~88~12~192~51~4782~1045~Tzatziki is a popular Greek sauce made from yogurt, cucumbers, garlic, and dill. Here we've subbed in shallots for garlic and used it to top skewers of shrimp. Serve any leftovers with pita chips, as a substitute for mayo on roast chicken sandwiches, or as a sauce for grilled lamb.
5006479~Tuna, Pickle, and Chopped-Vegetable Pita Sandwiches~974~123~22~25~40~1917~48~Highly recommended!
5010470~Mango-Sesame Dressing~2327~137~88~3~201~2390~2~You'll use some of the dressing for the grilled chicken and the rest for the noodle salad .
5006481~Watermelon-Mint Ice Cubes~817~200~200~0~0~56~0~"Brandi Neuwirth of Cary, North Carolina, writes: ""My family and I moved here from Los Angeles last year, and my new surroundings have really influenced my cooking. There's a great farmers' market nearby where I get lots of local ingredients. The produce there inspired me to create this dish, which is a real taste of the South."""
5006482~Grilled Shrimp with Fiery Lemongrass-Chile Sambal~3143~107~38~295~164~6298~2642~To read of my travels, you might get the impression that for most of the last three years, I've done nothing but prowl night markets and food stalls. True, a lot of great grilling takes place on Third World street corners, but you can also find some pretty amazing barbecue at luxury resorts. One such place is Amandari, a hotel built right into a rice paddy near the artist town of Ubud, Bali. Dinner began with a Balinese welcome dance performed by local children in gold-embroidered gowns. My wife, Barbara, and I dined at a table for two strewn with rose petals in an open pavilion facing a lily pond. A team of chefs cooked for us and us alone on portable grills over charcoal. The succession of dishes—grilled shrimp with fiery lemongrass sambal, Balinese grilled chicken, and whole grilled fish with kaffir lime leaves—revealed Balinese cooking in all its polymorphic glory. A profoundly complex cuisine only hinted at in the food at your typical street-corner stall.
5006483~Feta Spread with Rosemary and Lemon~420~11~3~33~36~1680~119~Similar to the whipped feta spread at Papagus Greek Taverna in Chicago.
5006484~Chocolate-Praline Cake in a Jar~5713~982~770~105~224~2595~686~For a few years now I've been a judge at the Whirlpool Accubake Unique Cake Contest, which is similar to the Pillsbury Bake-Off. A chocolate cake with a pecan and butterscotch toffee topping called Chocolate Coffee Toffee Cake by Elizabeth Kirsch from Pennsylvania won first place in 2002 and the $10,000 prize, which she donated to Heifer International. Elizabeth told me she made her cakes in glass canning jars and would tuck one into her husband's business trip luggage so he wouldn't miss his favorite cake while he was out of town. This simplified version of her cake would be perfect to take to a picnic or even a backyard barbecue

5006492~Prime Rib Roast with Red-Wine Sauce~1543~103~50~33~103~8272~303~Big and beefy, this luscious cut of meat definitely has a celebratory presence. Here it partners with porcini mushrooms, which are both rubbed on the roast and incorporated into the sauce. For the best flavor, look for well-marbled meat.
5006493~Ditalini with Chickpeas and Garlic-Rosemary Oil~2863~391~15~57~121~1089~0~This version of pasta e ceci (pasta with chickpeas) thickens the sauce with puréed chickpeas, and it's finished with a fresh garlic-and-rosemary oil, which adds great flavor and an even better aroma.
5006494~Beef Ribs with Orange and Smoked Paprika Sauce~419~29~18~6~29~309~7~Highly recommended!

5006496~Kung Pao Brussels Sprouts~1517~185~65~45~73~7205~0~A vegetarian twist on a Chinese take-out standard, these sprouts deliver crunch, spice, and zing.
5017579~Carrot Cupcakes with Orange Icing~4300~704~543~78~187~3141~370~These delightful cupcakes are great as soon as they've cooled, but their carrot-cake moistness and hint of spice really come through the day after they're baked.
5006498~Savory Bread Pudding with Mushrooms and Parmesan Cheese~4794~163~25~25~478~10385~1941~This rich, custard-like stuffing is also a great main-course option for vegetarians at the Thanksgiving table; it would be nice with a salad for brunch or lunch, too.
5006499~Shrimp Toasts With Sesame Seeds and Scallions~1081~88~16~79~43~2585~553~These dim sum–style shrimp toasts make a surprisingly simple—and utterly addictive—at-home snack. With this method, you don’t even need a deep fryer to pull them off.

5006511~Celery Root Risotto and Pesto~3707~346~40~166~189~10684~330~A mini-processor comes in handy for making the pesto.
5006512~Couscous and Chicken Salad with Orange-Balsamic Dressing~4016~728~214~119~13~1600~0~Currants, roasted peppers, chick-peas, olives, green onions and cilantro add color and flavor to this portable salad. To start, dip wedges of pita bread into store-bought hummus (a creamy puree of chick-peas and sesame paste, available at Middle Eastern markets). A slightly chilled Beaujolais or lemonade is a refreshing beverage choice.
5006513~Goan Red Spice Paste~642~159~120~0~0~42533~0~This is a spicy, vinegary paste from the beautiful region of Goa. It is great with meat, chicken and fish; I have used it in a few recipes to get you started. Just remember when you cook with it, it is all raw so it does need to be well cooked before you use it.
5006514~Fried Squid With Aioli~2196~57~5~38~203~2165~59~How does this remain shatteringly crisp? The secret is hiding in the batter: potato starch and arepa flour, the tickets to everlasting crunchiness.
5006515~Salmon Cakes with Lemon Yogurt Sauce~1754~66~11~124~111~1620~389~We've given eminently tasty salmon the crab-cake treatment. Topping the lovely, golden (and satisfyingly chunky) cakes is a tart, tangy yogurt sauce rather than the usual tartar.
5006516~Tomatoes in Chile-Fennel Oil~1218~54~43~10~110~217~0~Double the chile oil, keep it chilled, and drizzle it over flatbreads, pastas, and all of your grilled meats and vegetables all summer long.
5006517~"Lebanese Tomato ""Salsa"""~1371~163~120~10~61~4500~0~Briefly cooking the tomatoes is key–the finished sauce should still be very fresh-tasting.
5006518~Grilled Asian-Style Salmon with Cabbage and Mint Slaw~1493~278~136~36~29~7662~0~Serve with: Grilled portobello mushrooms and a rice salad with sliced radishes. Dessert: Scoops of coconut, pineapple, and passion-fruit sorbets drizzled with rum.
5006519~Baja-Style Tempura Fish~652~170~0~46~1~5983~0~Batter-fried fish tacos as we know them in the United States originated in the 1930s in Ensenada, Mexico, home to a large Japanese immigrant population who worked in the fishing industry there. Along with their skills as fishermen, the Japanese also brought with them the technique for tempura—deep-frying fish in batter. The Mexicans adapted this technique to make tacos, using young shark, a very inexpensive local catch that held up beautifully when fried. These tacos are best served immediately as fried foods get soggy if left to sit. If you can’t find shark, substitute a firm, moist white fish like opah, tilapia, or mahi mahi.
5006520~Smoke in Da Eye Grilled Coffee-Coriander-Rubbed New York Strip Steak~653~15~7~20~56~13200~54~We can always count on Clint Cantwell to come up with flavor profiles that, at first glance, make us blink like we just got smoke in our eyes.

5006647~Curried-Squash and Red-Lentil Soup~3027~280~27~63~188~1409~63~Sweet butternut squash, earthy red lentils, and curry powder are the stars of this lively vegetarian soup thats wonderful ladled over basmati rice. A drizzle of cilantro oil heightens the wow factor.
5006648~Warm Apple Tart with Date Ice Cream and Red Wine-Caramel Sauce~7090~1101~735~128~295~3140~714~Highly recommended!
5006649~Endive Leaves with Roasted Red Bell Pepper Salsa~178~4~3~0~16~416~0~In this colorful salsa, fennel, olives and rosemary combine with roasted bell peppers.
5012299~Scallops with Snail-Garlic Butter and Leeks~1109~68~19~19~78~258~245~Adapted from L'Ardoise
5006652~Five-Spice Pecan~3527~63~15~47~350~484~0~Give your loved ones a sniffle-free holiday season. Pecans deliver ample magnesium, a mineral that helps strengthen the immune system.
5006654~Coconut and Pistachio Baklava~5289~594~548~43~326~11~632~"I use a French orange flower water, Vallauris brand, that I brought back from Nice. If your orange flower water is from the Middle East (most often Lebanon) you will need to use more to taste; the Middle Eastern-style is not as strongly flavored as the French version. I also use Athens brand phyllo (it says ""fillo"" on the box), which comes in a 1-pound container with two separate packages inside. Make sure to use unsalted pistachios. This baklava is actually not at all difficult to make, but take care not to press down on the layers of pastry as you layer and then cut them."
5006655~Lamb Stir-Fry with Pomegranate and Yogurt~939~67~16~9~68~80~4~Affordable leg of lamb is a great way to break out of the usual beef-chicken-pork rut, especially when used in a quick-cooking but complex-tasting dish like this.
5006656~Bo Ssäm~2977~714~339~43~20~273~5~Our bo ssäm was a long time in the making before it showed up on the menu. I'd had an inkling for years it would be a good idea—bo ssäm is a supercommon dish in Korean restaurants, though the ingredients and cooking that go into it are frequently an afterthought. The oysters are usually Gulf oysters from a bucket, the kind that are really only suited to frying; the pork is belly that's been boiled into submission. Almost every time I ate it at a restaurant, I'd think about how much better it would be if all the ingredients were awesome.
5006657~Sweet Potato–Miso Pie With Chocolate-Sesame Crust~2637~309~232~28~217~2556~605~We tested this pie recipe with canned sweet potatoes, but it just wasn’t as good. Go fresh or go home.
5006658~Pierogies with Stewed Sauerkraut and Mushrooms~1494~136~54~17~93~2528~256~Pierogies are large dumplings filled with meat, cheese or vegetables, and they are very popular in Poland. A precooked version is available frozen in many supermarkets.
5006659~Five-Spice Pork and Green Bean Stir-Fry~1119~89~35~8~75~4119~0~Highly recommended!
5006660~Kale with Garlic and Cranberries~1510~192~79~32~76~399~0~Garlicky kale, a robust winter green, gains an unexpected twist with dried cranberries' saucy hits of tartness.
5006661~Porcini Chicken with Wild Rice and Wheat Berries~3239~462~24~220~36~10598~439~Highly recommended!
5006662~Kielbasa with Golden Onions and Apple~3738~70~51~141~302~10543~795~Sweet caramelized onions and a tart Granny Smith apple are a perfect balancing act, especially when combined with rich smoked sausage.
5006664~Arugula and Mixed Green Salad with Sausage and Fennel~722~69~28~29~41~1191~0~Highly recommended!
5006665~Grilled Clams With Herb Butter~927~4~1~9~96~789~277~When spooned over smoky, just-off-the-grill clams, this herb-flecked butter melts into their briny juices to create a delicious, effortless sauce.
5007676~Tomato Papaya Salsa~550~144~126~0~0~100~0~Papaya brings a fresh twist to the traditional tomato salsa.
5006668~Turkey Samosas~20913~728~51~290~1941~28255~367~Naomi Pomeroy, chef/owner of Beast and Expatriate in Portland, Oregon, shared this recipe exclusively with Epicurious. Filled with leftover turkey, mashed potatoes, and peas or green beans, these samosas are a Thanksgiving-themed take on a dish from Pomeroy's newest restaurant, Expatriate. At the restaurant, Pomeroy serves the samosas over a cabbage and herb salad, and drizzled with tamarind brown butter dressing, but the samosas are so flavorful, we like them on their own. If you want to include a dipping sauce or two, Pomeroy recommends this Cilantro-Mint Chutney and/or purchased mango chutney. Of course, you can always serve them on a bed of greens.
5006669~Steamed Egg Custard with Blue Crab and Flowering Chives~914~44~2~89~37~7255~669~The spirit of Japan comes through in this dish: It is lovely to behold and has a delicate, light quality, yet the extraordinary flavors will seize your attention with the culinary equivalent of surround sound.
5006670~Herby Black Rice Salad with Radishes and Ricotta Salata~2138~256~35~60~104~2473~30~Make the rice before you leave, and pack the vinaigrette in a little jar on the side. You'll thank us, Scout's honor.
5006671~Tomato-Rubbed Bruschetta~670~121~18~22~23~668~0~This bruschetta tastes best with tomatoes fresh from the garden.

5019424~Pumpkin Bread Pudding with Spicy Caramel Apple Sauce~7149~1155~192~176~218~11448~687~This fantastic dessert is perfect for the cool months of late fall and winter. Cubes of tender pumpkin bread are baked in a rich custard laced with bourbon and maple syrup. Crisp apple cider is the base of a buttery caramel sauce spiced with fresh ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and star anise. Forget about serving the same-old pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving and put this out instead for a new twist on two old classics. The recipe includes directions for making your own pumpkin bread to use in the pudding, but you can of course also use a loaf of pumpkin bread from your favorite bakery. Brioche or cinnamon-raisin bread would also work perfectly.
5006677~Orange Belgian Coffee~1071~108~82~14~67~500~242~Highly recommended!
5006678~Leek and Cannellini Bean Soup~1745~121~50~34~128~9641~69~This soup is a terrific choice for those over sixty, as it's abundant in nutrients one especially needs later in life. These include healthy plant protein (older adults are prone to protein insufficiency), fiber, vitamin K, potassium, lysine to aid in calcium absorption, and folate to help reduce homocysteine levels, which are a major risk factor for heart disease. And of course, all soups are soft and so are a favorite for anyone with dental difficulties.
5006679~Blackberry, Honey and Yogurt Pops~587~136~125~8~0~157~9~To make these at home, look for ice pop molds with narrow openings for inserting the sticks. They can be found in cookware stores and at amazon.com. The author makes these and other pops for New York-based People's Pops.
5006680~Spiked Blackberry Coulis~400~102~97~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!

5006685~Squid, Lemon, and Zucchini Blossom Fritto Misto~3243~305~6~193~214~4143~130~During summer months, find zucchini blossoms at specialty grocers or at farmers’ markets. Halved scallions can be used instead, and small shrimp can stand in for the squid.

5006687~Arugula, Fennel, Apple, Mandarin Orange, and Pomegranate Salad~1431~82~53~33~110~435~0~This refreshing and versatile salad sets off some of the more decadent dishes at Isa.
5006688~Citrus-Marinated Olives~3145~76~39~0~220~40~0~Take these olives along on your next picnic.
5018017~Cinnamon-Rum Ice Cream~2399~249~242~20~157~666~638~As befitting a diner dessert, this ice cream is thick and rich and perfectly accents the apple tartlet. Cinnamon ice cream generally falls into three categories: infused via cinnamon sticks during the milk warming; ground cinnamon added during the milk warming; and ground cinnamon added at the very end. You can't get a real cinnamony flavor from the sticks alone, and adding ground cinnamon too early makes for a very strange texture. The third option lends a nice flavor and texture and leaves the custard pleasantly speckled.
5006690~Vegetable Enchiladas~4822~886~105~134~84~14706~71~They pack almost all your daily vitamin C.
5006691~Butternut Squash and Fried Sage Pasta~1443~220~14~48~36~2312~48~A hearty bowl of pasta plus savory cheese? You'd never know this whole-grain comfort food is diet-friendly! Squash supplies all the vitamin A you need for the day.

5006709~Winter Squash Soup with Gruyère Croutons~2550~164~36~78~167~3126~477~In France, this soup would be prepared with a baking pumpkin. A mixture of butternut and acorn squashes mimics the French pumpkin's exceptional taste and texture. Pour a lightly chilled rosé with this colorful first course. Either a Rhône Tavel or a Provençal Bandol would be lovely.
5006710~Spaghettini with Gorgonzola, Leeks and Shallots~4351~605~118~123~141~1832~236~Highly recommended!
5006711~Cilantro Coconut Rice~3003~582~5~52~51~2178~10~We decided to use sweetened flaked coconut rather than fresh coconut for this recipe because it not only saves time but enhances the overall flavor of the dish, adding a touch of subtle sweetness. Soaking the basmati rice strengthens the grains to prevent the rice from breaking down during cooking.
5006713~Salmon with Horseradish Green Goddess Sauce~760~8~0~0~84~803~126~Highly recommended!
5006714~Pumpkin Bread Puddings Brûlée~2464~356~294~38~94~1098~395~"Ella Brennan, who has been called the ""queen of Creole cuisine,"" tasted her first bread pudding long ago. ""It was my mother's,"" she says. ""You never had anything like it."""
5016429~Grilled Swordfish Verde~1697~167~37~19~116~2542~1~The verde on the succulent swordfish comes from the cilantro and chili marinade and a silky avocado mayonnaise. Start out with salsa and tortilla chips, and serve Mexican beer throughout the meal.
5006717~Potato, Carrot and Parsnip Soup~1415~137~47~19~82~3678~273~Highly recommended!

5006720~Beet Carpaccio with Goat Cheese and Mint Vinaigrette~1143~24~21~42~105~1481~167~Thinly sliced beets (not beef) lay the foundation for this vibrant rendition of the Italian appetizer. Use any assortment of small beets — red, golden, purple, or candy-striped. A local farmers' market will have the best selection. The beets can be roasted and peeled one day before serving.
5006721~Orange Chiffon Cake~5151~944~518~87~118~3146~11~Highly recommended!
5006722~Grilled Skirt Steak with Herb Salsa Verde~1306~34~0~18~121~714~48~The secret to this flavorful sauce, which is delicious with almost all grilled meat and fish, is to use any herb that looks good at the market. Just be sure to include parsley: It gives the salsa backbone.
5006723~Champagne Parfaits with Pears and Raspberries~4422~637~316~31~168~1700~4~The parfaits can be made a day ahead.
5006724~Deconstructed Caprese~22~4~3~1~0~40000~0~The deconstructed caprese is a sandwich on a skewer, featuring crusty bread, mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, and basil. While it looks sort of fussy, its actually a snap to pull together and it has a colorful presentation that looks quite smashing in a lunch box. Small mozzarella balls, also known as bocconcini, measure about an inch across and are sold in the specialty cheese section of many supermarkets. Pack the skewers with a little side of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for lunchtime dipping. For bigger appetites, increase the recipe by 50 percent, which will make three skewers instead of two.
5006725~Lentil Soup with Mustard Oil and Tomato-Chive Topping~4856~566~24~350~71~236680~15~Highly recommended!
5006727~Pea Shoot and Spinach Salad with Bacon and Shiitakes~604~30~9~13~48~3094~0~Pea shoots are the tender, leafy branch tips of edible pea plants (not to be confused with flowering sweet peas, which are poisonous). There are huge variations in taste among shoots from different varieties, but the sweetest are those from edible podded peas.

5006734~Citrus Arancine with Pecorino Cheese~16017~461~20~144~1560~10961~646~These deep-fried rice balls hail from Sicily. Arancine are often made with leftover risotto, but this recipe calls for freshly made risotto. A piece of cheese is tucked into the rice mixture, then the rice balls are breaded and fried until golden.
5006735~Chicken Fricassée with Figs and Port Sauce~1054~96~23~14~56~2674~149~The figs for the sauce need to marinate overnight, so start one day ahead.

5006751~Nectarine Cake Squares~1537~164~13~80~105~2241~585~This is best eaten the day it's made — left to sit longer, the cake can get a bit soggy from the fruit.
5006752~Black-and-White Baked Alaska~2161~375~357~44~64~751~8~This stunning sweet from Spago Beverly Hills can be assembled ahead of time, then baked at the last minute.

5006753~Roasted Sweet Potatoes & Fresh Figs~1968~247~163~36~103~3466~100~"Figs are abundant in Jerusalem and many trees, bearing the most delectable fruit, actually belong to no one, so anybody can help themselves. Summer months are always tinted with the smell of wild herbs and ripe figs. The mother of Sami's childhood neighbor and friend, Jabbar, used her roof to dry the glut of figs (and tomatoes) in the hot summer sun, spending hours cleaning and sorting them meticulously. Poor Um Jabbar Sami and her son never wasted time and used to sneak up to her roof regularly, stealing her figs at their peak and causing havoc. This wasn't enough for Jabbar, though. The boy had such a sweet tooth that he always carried around with him an old match box full of sugar cubes, just in case. Unfortunately, this habit had clear ramifications, evident in his ""charming"" smile."

5006776~Rabbit Punch~3075~567~487~11~86~1694~0~Matt Wallace, bartender at Harvard & Stone in Los Angeles, created this potent fruit-filled punch for our story Spring Cocktails Perfect for Brunch. The combination of pineapple, orange, and lemon plus the crisp, dry bubbles from the Champagne really wake up your palate after a long winter, he says. The citrus and sugar base is called oleo-saccharum, and is common in older punch recipes. Wallace says it's an excellent way to add a subtle citrusy perfume to the final drink, and requires time but very little labor.
5006777~Grilled-Vegetable Pasta Salad with Parsley Vinaigrette~3022~468~49~60~95~6393~44~For extra eye appeal, use tricolor pasta in this fresh-from-the-garden salad.
5006778~Chicken Muffuletta Salad~1523~78~21~70~68~4825~266~This salad — named after the famous New Orleans sandwich — would also be good on oversize rolls. Suitable sides include onion rings and carrot sticks with blue cheese dip. End with praline ice cream cones.
5006779~Orange Roughy with Indian-Spiced Tomato Sauce~357~14~7~7~28~426~67~Serve this fragrant main dish with basmati rice pilaf and a salad of cucumber, yellow bell peppers, and red onion. Melon wedges sprinkled with light rum and garnished with mint make a refreshing finale.

5006781~Broiled Sea Trout with Basil Sauce~647~34~1~0~55~0~0~Tomato gratin or potato, red pepper, and fennel salad would make a terrific accompaniment to the fish.
5010292~Smoked Fish Chowder~1876~247~79~52~67~6146~320~Offer crackers and some coleslaw along with the chowder. Lemon meringue pie is a perfect way to end the meal.

5019130~Classic Roast Turkey With Herbed Stuffing and Old-Fashioned Gravy~605~51~7~23~46~7177~126~After trying every turkey-roasting method under the sun, I've finally settled on this as absolutely the best. The secret? Slow down the cooking of the breast area, which tends to get overcooked and dried out before the dark meat is done, with a cover of aluminum foil.
5006785~Grilled Citrus Chicken~455~20~11~0~44~1~0~Highly recommended!
5006786~Weeknight Mapo Tofu With Ground Pork~1675~89~14~88~98~5585~130~Spicy, mouth-tingling, porky: Those are the words you’ll be using to describe this tofu recipe.
5006787~Chicken Fricassée with Creamy Sweet-and-Sour Dill Sauce~1489~174~80~40~76~4275~305~Traditional Scandinavian fare, this rich stew is comfort food at its best — think chicken potpie without the crust. Boiled potatoes are the perfect starch to balance the sweet carrots and parsnips.
5006788~"Cauliflower ""Bistecche"" with Pancetta and Caper Berries"~672~100~92~3~27~2789~0~"For this recipe, it's best to choose a head of cauliflower with a very dense crown so that the ""steaks"" will hold together during cooking. However, even if they separate a bit, the dish is still delicious."
5006789~Chicken Breasts with Horseradish-Scallion Crust~1124~97~7~37~63~1840~128~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5006790~Salmon and Scallop Terrine with Frisée Salad~1388~17~6~4~139~4792~0~This update on a classic terrine is made with an aromatic broth and olive oil instead of cream. If you're short on time, don't bother with the leek lining—though it is pretty, the terrine works fine without it.
5006791~Tiramisu Wedding Cake with Mixed Berries~29639~5570~3984~276~717~11780~1853~Highly recommended!
5015838~Champagne Punch~2296~385~328~23~62~3945~96~"Eye-opening notes of lemon, lime, and grapefruit keep this festive punch from heading into ultra-sweet territory—and fresh mint seconds the motion. ""Once the Champagne has been added,"" says Scott Peacock, ""serve the drinks as soon as possible to experience the maximum tickle of bubbles."""
5006793~Tea-Flavored Tarte Tatin (Tarte Tatin au Thé)~1636~100~11~10~141~746~214~Highly recommended!
5006794~Grilled Vegetables with Mint Raita~2112~232~62~31~99~1075~105~Improv: Add or substitute corn on the cob, eggplant slices, or portobellos.
5006795~Spaghetti with Parsley Pesto~4194~379~3~96~266~1269~97~We love a classic pesto Genovese. But why be limited to basil? Swapping in flat-leaf parsley makes for a balanced sauce that allows you to really taste the nuts, the olive oil, the Parmesan. Sturdy parsley is also easier to find year-round (and more affordable) than basil. Use this sauce as you would any pesto: spooned over grilled vegetables, spread on a sandwich, and, yes, swirled into pasta. Bonus: Parsley pesto holds its vibrant color much longer than the other stuff.

5006802~Irish Stew With Pearl Barley~426~85~6~9~0~184~0~There’s no point in trying to reinvent the wheel when it comes to our great national dish. Having said that, I do love sneaking in lots of gutsy garlic. For the best result, be sure to ask for thick chops on the bone. When made well it’s not hard to see why this is one of Ireland’s favorite dishes.

5006819~Hot Rice Cereal with Dried Mango and Toasted Coconut~1309~240~52~36~17~527~56~This surprisingly rich-tasting cereal is a healthful rice pudding — for breakfast. If you can't find dried mango in your local supermarket or natural foods store, you can use dried apricots instead.

5006824~Mexican Coffee Pudding with Kahlúa Whipped Cream~2150~257~171~15~113~473~449~Mexican coffee is spiked with Kahlúa, but in these simple puddings, the liqueur is on top, whipped into cream.

5006826~Creamy Cilantro and Almond Soup~1402~41~20~37~122~5710~168~"Juana Vázquez-Gómez of Redondo Beach, California, writes: ""Growing up in Cuernavaca, just outside Mexico City, I remember my grandmother cooking elaborate Mexican meals every day. My mother continued that tradition, but not in such an all-consuming manner. For her it was a great joy to plan a menu and then invite people to help with the preparation."

5006833~Cold Curried Pea and Buttermilk Soup~475~22~10~5~37~2764~63~The buttermilk in this soup gives it a light, tangy richness that harmonizes with the sweetness of the peas and the gentle bite of the curry. Though it looks lovely in a bowl, serve this soup in drinking glasses, to be sipped rather than spooned, for a nice change of pace.
5006834~Turkish-Spiced Chicken Kebabs with Pomegranate Relish and Tahini Yogurt~1661~130~51~47~102~1799~73~Ana Sortun, chef-owner of Oleana in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is known for her modern interpretation of Middle Eastern and Turkish cuisine. When it comes to chicken breasts, she seeks out local, organic birds and chooses a flavorful spice rub. One of her favorite seasonings is baharat, a Middle Eastern spice mixture that includes cumin, oregano, and dried mint. Here, she pairs chicken skewers with a cooling yogurt sauce and a colorful pomegranate and pistachio relish.
5006835~Veal Loin Stuffed with Bell Peppers, Goat Cheese and Basil~1332~101~17~42~77~5203~178~A stylish dinner party dish with a bonus: Much of the prep work can be done a day ahead. At the store, have the butcher bone and trim all of the fat and membrane from a 4 3/4-pound center-cut veal rib roast, resulting in a 3-pound oblong boneless veal loin.
5006836~Maru~433~108~94~1~0~55~0~Maru is the name of the adorable Japanese cat whose love of jumping into and out of boxes has inspired us to waste many happy hours drinking beer in front of our computer when we should have been working instead. This cocktail has the popular Japanese lager Sapporo as its base, a crisp and well-carbonated brew that is typically paired with sushi. Here, the slight bitterness of the beer is tempered by tart berries and mandarin oranges.
5014685~Lamb Spice Rub~9~0~0~0~0~5816~0~Highly recommended!
5006838~Spinach-Basil Pesto~1810~41~2~53~165~3546~59~This pesto if very simple, and its mild, herbaceous flavor makes it the ideal companion for just about any of the meatballs. While many pesto recipes call for pine nuts, we prefer the flavor (and lower price) of walnuts. Try finely chopping them and adding them right at the end for a nice, crunchy texture. We also love this as a healthy party dip, especially because it has no raw garlic—your guests will thank you too! Just cut up some carrots, cherry tomatoes, bell peppers, and celery and you're ready to go. You can swap arugula for spinach if you prefer. Pesto freezes well and will keep for up to three months in the freezer.
5006840~Coffee-Toffee Crunch Torte~10386~632~345~172~827~4139~1307~Layers of toffee-studded, coffee-flavored mousse and chocolate ganache fill an almond and sugar-cookie crust.

There are said to be hundreds of ways to prepare it. Peppers and artichokes are almost as well loved and common. A country cook often gets produce from a small kitchen garden called an ""urtu""."

5006874~Green Bean, Corn, and Coconut Stir-Fry (Thoren)~811~96~13~17~32~749~0~I grew up on green beans thoren, and while I'll never tire of its crunchy deliciousness, I think adding corn makes it even better. And even though people don't often associate stir-fries with Indian cooking, this dish is a favorite in Kerala. It's a combination of diced vegetables and coconut, but the key is moistening the coconut so it can soak up the ground spices first. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.
5006875~White Chocolate and Fresh Raspberry Terrine~3880~425~338~36~242~1008~446~The trick to this gorgeous dessert is to use imported white chocolate and to melt it carefully, since white chocolate is extremely heat sensitive.

5006884~Peanut Butter Chocolate Eggs~5403~260~202~28~486~3910~1098~Who doesn't love the combination of chocolate and peanut butter? These eggs are like an upscale version of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. You can actually make them in any mold you like, but I generally make them egg-shaped. To do it my way, you will need plastic or polycarbonate egg molds (see tips, below) to make perfectly shaped ovals. They are avilable in various sizes at most candy- and cake-supply stores. Make sure that they are very clean and dry before using, or the chocolate will stick.

5015279~Challah~8730~1541~649~332~162~9967~440~What's wonderful about challah is that it can be used in so many ways: to sanctify the Sabbath, of course, but just as important, to make French toast, grilled cheese, and croutons and as breading in meatballs. Maybe not the way God intended it, but I'm sure She understands. Israel is the land of milk and honey, and this challah has both. For those of you who want to stay away from milk, it's fine to substitute water.

Crushing and steeping the saffron in hot water brings out its full flavor and color. If you have coconut oil on hand, the naturally sweet flavor pairs nicely with the cherries and almonds.

5006900~Quick Seafood Cocktail Sauce~248~49~38~0~1~3498~0~Here's an easy-to-make sauce for shrimp or crab claws. It's also good prepared with fresh dill or thyme instead of tarragon.
5006901~Sun-Dried Tomato, Coriander, and Roasted Red Pepper Dip~1042~93~16~28~53~2943~153~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5006902~Red Beans and Rice~4188~621~5~127~146~5210~290~Garlic bread is perfect on the side. You can find Creole or Cajun seasoning in the spice section of most supermarkets.
5006903~Pear Croustade with Hazelnut-Brown Sugar Topping~5026~858~365~52~138~1003~378~A rustic tart with a delicious hazelnut crust, sweet filling and buttery topping.
5008595~Buttery Cornbread~2092~241~66~32~104~2716~288~The bread is terrific on its own, too.
5006905~Mustard-Maple Ham Steaks with Cider-Madeira Sauce~2353~572~482~17~1~3169~54~Sweet and salty, the ham is great served with roasted potatoes and applesauce.
5006906~Individual Blueberry-Coconut Pound Cakes~2131~294~192~55~117~648~682~Mini pound cakes are not only delicious but a perfect dessert for picnics or box lunches. For a more formal look, pur e some blueberries with a little sugar and serve the sauce over the cakes.
5006907~Lemon-Thyme Cranberry Sauce~157~40~34~0~0~14~43~Highly recommended!
5006908~Spinach Salad with Pecorino, Pine Nuts, and Currants~824~76~22~36~42~1079~0~Be sure to buy four extra cups of spinach if you plan to make the frittata.
5008481~Brandied Date and Walnut Pie~1232~149~145~13~66~1114~496~A western twist on the old-fashioned pecan pie . California walnuts, dates and brandy give this pie its candy-bar flavor.
5006910~Butternut Squash and Corn Chowder~3215~486~42~55~134~12244~0~A spice combination that is inspired by Indian cuisine enhances this sensational soup. Riesling or Sauvignon Blanc as a refreshing partner.
5006911~Three-Cheese Phyllo Triangles with Onions and Yogurt~3439~284~15~140~187~5042~724~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are excerpted from Diane Kochilas's book Meze: Small Plates to Savor and Share from the Mediterranean Table.

5006912~Berry Berry Sundaes~2322~452~334~86~41~766~75~Highly recommended!
5006913~Cauliflower Purée and Caviar on Cloverleaf Potato Chips~1203~96~25~12~79~2819~214~Though the chips and purée can be served at room temperature, the caviar should be chilled, so assemble these hors d'oeuvres in batches as platters need replenishing.
5016984~Steamed Red Snapper with Ginger, Chiles, and Sesame Oil~596~7~0~28~59~1415~71~Steaming, a method often used by Asian cooks, works well with delicately flavored red snapper, since the aromatics (ginger, scallion, chile) are easily absorbed by the fish.
5006915~Marbled Pumpkin Cheesecake~2357~469~437~35~49~693~496~Highly recommended!
5017407~Lemon Ice Cream with Candied Lemon Peel~2022~241~234~33~109~1913~378~Editor's note: This recipe is adapted from Gabrielle Carbone, coproprietor of The Bent Spoon ice cream parlor in Princeton, New Jersey.

5006920~Worcestershire and Orange-Glazed Baby Back Ribs~4205~155~128~367~243~11048~1413~To create a meal around these sweet and pungent ribs, just add fresh corn on the cob and a salad of watercress, red onion and orange slices.
5014734~Fuzzy Navel~223~51~45~1~1~85~1~Highly recommended!

5016006~Beef Bourguignon~6842~277~133~372~461~52376~1295~Highly recommended!
5006928~Poached Eggs with Tomato Cilantro Sauce~566~36~3~33~26~2542~406~"In Mexico, this breakfast dish is called huevos ahogados, meaning ""drowned eggs,"" since the eggs are served in soup bowls with a lot of sauce."
5007809~Ginger-Sesame Sauce~870~16~7~5~90~2030~136~This spiced-up Asian-inspired sauce is perfect for dipping French fries or crudité, or for drizzling over seared chicken or fish.
5006930~Greens and Grains Scramble~584~47~4~16~37~867~371~This is the breakfast Sam and I probably eat most often regardless of the season. In truth, it's usually a dish we whip up as a late breakfast on weekdays when we're both working from home and most emails have been returned. It's wonderfully versatile and allows you to use up any leftover grains you have from previous meals, folding in leafy greens for a bit of color. In that sense, think of it more as a template rather than a hard-and-fast approach. Any leafy greens and most grains will work, although I veer away from small, delicate grains like amaranth because they can get lost in the dish.
5006931~Portobello Mushroom Salad à la Grecque~1330~56~20~36~106~4549~79~The technique for cooking vegetables in water, oil, and vinegar is called à la Grecque, or Greek style. Fennel, celery, pearl onions, and feta cheese round out the salad. Serve a full-boded Chardonnay with it
5006933~Wild Rice with Smoked Fish and Snap Peas~2294~453~61~95~17~6698~380~Wild rice has an affinity for fish, and we think it's particularly good alongside tender pieces of smoked salmon. Crisp snow peas and wedges of hard-boiled egg round out the salad, and a refreshing dill vinaigrette brings all the flavors together.
5006934~Spinach, Corn and Roasted Pepper Salad with Chipotle Dressing~399~10~6~3~44~217~0~Add cooked shrimp to transform this salad into a light main course.
5006935~Steak with Parmesan Butter, Balsamic Glaze, and Arugula~847~66~47~22~51~1227~47~Simple and sophisticated.
5006936~Shrimp and Scallop Ceviche~851~52~36~137~8~2163~954~Highly recommended!
5006938~Halibut with Capers, Olives, and Tomatoes~901~16~9~0~55~530~0~"Mark Taylor of West Hartford, Connecticut, writes: ""I started cooking out of necessity when I first graduated from college, since I couldn't afford to eat out. Having grown up watching my mother cook for our large family, I used her recipes. She was always trying new dishes whenever we had guests and sharing her adventurous attitude toward eating. These days, even though my wife and I both work, we still cook several times a week. Now I tend to rely on recipes I've picked up from restaurants and friends. I enjoy experimenting with different ingredients and figuring out new ways to improve a recipe, as I've done with the one here."""

5006945~Spicy Coleslaw with Cumin-Lime Dressing~2374~290~164~32~118~6797~0~Highly recommended!
5018499~Strong Fish Stock~342~20~13~2~23~556~63~"This recipe uses a technique called ""sweating"" to extract maximum flavor from every ingredient. Although sweating adds a step, this stock is still effortless to make and takes only five minutes longer to cook than the Traditional Fish Stock."
5006949~Salmon Tartare~143~3~3~1~11~227~10~Use the freshest wild or farmed salmon for this dish. Chilling it in the freezer for 20 minutes makes it easier to dice.
5006951~Chocolate-Caramel Macadamia Nut Tart~3849~610~406~37~152~2910~367~A bittersweet chocolate ganache is spread in the bottom of the crust and is also piped on top of the nutty caramel filling.
5006952~Hazelnut Linzer Cookies with Blackberry Jam~5108~607~280~77~257~1717~383~Highly recommended!
5006953~Corn and Zucchini Salad with Feta~728~60~28~7~46~1245~44~Highly recommended!
5006954~Savory Grits with Shallots, Corn and Green Onions~242~38~18~3~9~2058~0~A quick and easy side dish that goes well with roast chicken, turkey or pork chops.
5006956~Marinated Vegetables with Garlic and Thyme~2692~246~54~41~176~6571~0~Boiling away the butter and seasonings from the leftover vegetables allows the flavors of the marinade to shine through. (If you don't have any leftover veggies, simply steam a mix of your favorites.)
5006957~Restorative Beef Broth~548~120~43~2~3~903~0~Sip this beefy, faintly sweet broth as is, or, to make it even heartier, simmer diced root vegetables and/or little pastas in it.
5006958~Glazed Ham~1944~374~335~57~28~1588~157~Chef Kris Wessel of Florida Cookery in Miami Beach, Florida, shared this recipe as part of a Palm Tree Christmas menu he created exclusively for Epicurious. You can also use this orange glaze on a 12-pound bone-in pork loin. See the Cook's Note for cooking times.
5015305~Preserved Lemons~526~108~103~0~0~23264~0~(Djej Emshmel)
5006960~Vietnamese Pork Chops with Pickled Watermelon~1567~153~114~28~91~6624~69~This dish is a bold mix of salty, sweet, and acidic components. Crunchy slabs of melon and sharp greens keep it fresh; meaty chops provide depth.
5006961~Goat Cheese-Arugula Ravioli with Tomato-Pancetta Butter~2251~26~16~91~202~3808~525~This is a great entrée for entertaining or for a special weeknight dinner for your family. Either way, no one except you will know how easy it is to make. And your secret is safe with us.
5006962~Ziti with Grilled-Gazpacho Sauce and Sausage~6289~563~258~238~339~279949~448~The classic cold soup seems almost restrained next to this lusty dish — gazpacho ingredients are grilled, then tossed with pasta and cheese (some of the vegetables are puréed to make a tangy sauce that lightly cloaks the whole). The sausages are cooked separately, so this recipe will come in handy when there are vegetarians around.
5006963~Almond Dacquoise with Strawberry Ice Cream~2168~87~34~78~175~1145~56~Active time: 1 1/2 hr Start to finish: 9 hr
5006964~"Spicy Fried Chicken Wing ""Drumsticks"""~2451~121~23~216~146~5211~691~Highly recommended!
5006965~Blueberry Ice Cream Pie~5113~239~146~136~424~1809~315~A quick almond crust gets filled with ice cream and topped with cardamom-scented whipped cream and berries.
5006966~Caramelized Potatoes~2721~548~144~50~29~17554~47~This is not a sweet dish—don't be fooled by the first step for the sauce, making a caramel. Browning the sugar brings out savory and bitter notes that balance out the silky, earthy potatoes in an irresistible way. Though this dish is actually a Danish Christmas classic, we think these gorgeous potatoes should be cooked a lot more often than just once a year.
5006967~Catfish with Green Olives~726~15~0~15~73~2705~82~Highly recommended!
5006969~Grilled Red Onions with Balsamic Vinegar and Rosemary~518~90~62~9~13~0~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5006970~Fresh Goat Cheese, Roasted Beet, and Walnut Tart~3065~53~21~65~296~2091~715~As the tart bakes, some of the beet juice will color the custard and the goat cheese, giving each slice a pretty, almost marbleized look. Since the flavors are a riff on the classic beet, walnut, and goat cheese salad, this tart pairs especially well with greens tossed with a bright vinaigrette. A small slice also makes a somewhat unusual but delicious side dish to grilled lamb chops.
5016981~Broiled Salmon with Citrus Yogurt Sauce~257~4~3~0~27~1463~0~This recipe serves 4 as a main course after you set aside one third of the fish (see cooks' note, below) to make the capellini with salmon and lemon-dill-vodka sauce. Otherwise, it serves 6.
5006974~Steaks with Blue Cheese and Toasted Walnut Butter~1052~8~1~18~103~1183~178~The cheese and walnut topping adds a touch of elegance to simple steak
5006975~Sweet Potatoes with Orange Bitters~1078~98~53~10~67~615~76~"One of my greatest idols is Ruth Reichl, a clever writer who delightfully manages to approach food with just the right balance of weightiness and sense of humor, the latter often a rare commodity among ""serious"" authors. I love Reichl's recipes, I love her storytelling, and I always benefit from her vast knowledge. This recipe-a rhapsody for sweet, bitter, and salty-is based on one of hers, published in Gourmet Today, a selection from the sadly defunct Gourmet magazine, which Reichl edited for many years."
5006977~Jícama, Cucumber, and Chile Slaw~284~23~21~4~19~956~17~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5006978~Brussels Sprout and Apple Salad with Blue Cheese and Walnuts~10981~321~81~351~960~13148~836~Highly recommended!
5006979~Cornish Hens with Sweet Vermouth Garlic Glaze~420~83~0~0~25~2575~0~Highly recommended!
5006980~T-Bone Steak with Thyme and Garlic Butter~825~33~0~19~79~31~180~Is there anything better than a beautifully cooked steak? I love the simple flavors in this recipe—just great-quality meat paired with a garlicky herb butter. Perfect!
5006981~Ginger Yogurt with Berries and Crunchy Caramel~1246~294~278~3~0~66~4~Assemble the berries and yogurt up to a few hours ahead, then pour the caramel over shortly before serving.
5006982~Buttermilk Panna Cotta with Tropical Fruit~3401~383~246~35~180~1849~342~Tangy buttermilk custards are a delicious foil for sweet tropical fruit.
5006983~Hollywood Thai Beef Salad~2052~327~135~72~39~26552~75~The Standard Hollywood, which serves celebrities such as Heather Graham and Megan Mullally, has a trendy diner feel, but you'll find more than the burger special on the menu. Executive chef David Linville offers international treats like this salad with protein-rich lean flank steak.
5006984~Sicilian-Style Pasta with Sardines~3844~460~86~73~203~1637~0~Highly recommended!
5006985~Coffee Fruitcake~4019~739~669~50~111~7000~596~Highly recommended!

5006989~Grilled Lamb Skewers with Spiced Mint Marinade~2039~481~360~2~4~341~0~Fresh leaves give the classic lamb and mint sauce pairing a new twist. Great with jasmine rice and bok choy.
5006990~Butternut Squash with Shallots and Sage~368~28~21~0~27~1363~0~Highly recommended!
5006991~Chineasy Cucumber Salad~303~10~5~7~24~736~0~Highly recommended!

5006994~Brandy Blazer No.2~964~201~198~5~10~89~0~Highly recommended!
5006995~Nectarine and Blackberry Cobbler~1404~380~125~101~8~2698~21~If you're making this entire menu, we recommend assembling the cobbler and putting it into the oven just before you begin grilling the steak. That way, the cobbler will be cool enough to serve after you have finished eating the main course and cleared the table.
5006996~Spicy Sausage Linguine~3561~393~22~136~169~7228~341~Highly recommended!
5011156~Herb-Crusted Beef Rib Roast with Potatoes, Carrots, and Pinot Noir Jus~6398~1177~295~142~105~32905~215~Nothing says Christmas quite like a standing beef rib roast. For starters, it's got good bones. And those bones give it stature—there's nothing petite about this hunk of beef—so it is a commanding presence on your holiday table. That other holiday favorite, beef tenderloin, can't begin to compare in brawn or beefiness.
5006998~3-Ingredient Peanut Butter Cookies~2331~281~258~68~118~232~4~In Epi's 3-Ingredient Recipes series, we show you how to make great food with just three ingredients (plus staples like oil, salt, and pepper).
5006999~Braised Kashmiri Greens~767~92~6~21~24~2494~10~>Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are adapted from Floyd Cardoz's book, One Spice, Two Spice. The dish is also part of a special menu Chef Cardoz created for Epicurious's Wine.Dine.Donate program.
5007000~Grilled Swordfish with Fresh Tomato-Herb Salsa~343~46~17~3~13~35~0~A high-protein dish loaded with flavor. Purchased sorbet makes a nice dessert.
5007001~Butternut Squash Soup with Spiced Crème Fraîche~2238~275~105~41~112~7891~325~Editor's note: This recipe is part of a special Thanksgiving menu created by chefs Allison Vines-Rushing and Slade Rushing of MiLa restaurant in New Orleans. The licorice root is optional, but if used, will add a slightly sweet, woody flavor to this fall soup. If you can't find it locally, the chefs recommend Gourmet Spice Company as an online source.
5010960~Pasta with Pesto My Way~2413~242~71~47~134~7822~100~For the pesto mixture, executive food editor Kemp M. Minifie switches from pine nuts to pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds, and she incorporates flat-leaf parsley in with the basil. To top it all off she adds homemade bread crumbs. It's not quite Italian anymore, but it works.
5007003~Braised Lamb with Spinach~6092~523~388~314~318~13162~1107~Highly recommended!
5007004~Carrots and Rutabagas with Lemon and Honey~890~110~82~5~46~1537~126~Lemon juice adds refreshing flavor to earthy root vegetables.

5007493~Gazpacho~2620~315~17~50~130~4579~17~Highly recommended!
5007007~Chestnut, Bacon, Dried Apple, and Corn Bread Stuffing~9080~1607~238~246~144~30755~178~Two shortcuts — prepared chestnuts and a purchased corn bread stuffing base — add to the appeal of this recipe from chef and Aidells Sausage Company founder Bruce Aidells.
5007008~Seared Steak Lettuce Cups~495~44~22~27~22~1647~50~If you're looking for fresh hits of color and crunch for the buffet, here's your answer.
5007009~Apple-Cherry Tartlets~4814~648~534~4~252~691~600~These individual desserts have a spiced fruit filling that's a modern version of mincemeat.
5007010~Molasses-Brined Turkey with Gingersnap Gravy~8066~2098~344~156~164~202461~450~Brining ensures moist, succulent meat, and this recipe from Bruce Aidells, chef and founder of Aidells Sausage Company, could not be easier or more low-tech. The special equipment required? Two 30-gallon plastic bags and one very large (16-quart) bowl that will fit in the fridge. You'll want to get started a day ahead, because the turkey is brined for 18 to 20 hours. Stuffing this turkey is not recommended; the brine remaining in the meat may soak into the stuffing during roasting.
5007011~Grandma Knowlton's Pimiento Cheese~4359~38~0~164~404~6098~961~Highly recommended!

5007013~Fruit and Cookie-Crust Pizza~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~"""I’ve been cooking since I was twelve, and my husband, Bruce, picked it up during a ""Mr. Mom"" phase after our second daughter was born,"" writes Renee Davis of Cadiz, Ohio. ""We have a great time coming up with recipes together. If he concocts a dish, I’ll taste-test it, and vice versa. Some of our best (and worst) dishes have been the result of enthusiastic experimentation. I used to serve fresh fruit with a cream-cheese-and-marshmallow dip as an easy dessert after big barbecue meals, but we improved on that by adding a cookie crust and ended up with an entirely new dish."""
5007014~Sauteed Scallops with Vegetables~844~85~24~33~55~415~31~This preparation can be served in scallop-shell dishes for an impressive main course.
5007015~Burgers with Artichokes, Gorgonzola, and Tomatoes~3349~104~23~206~235~11809~669~These are equally good with either ground pork or ground lamb.
5007016~Scallion Cilantro Pancakes~669~117~5~65~19~1225~18~Highly recommended!
5007017~Soft Fish Tacos~3718~354~114~334~84~5552~631~Tacos de Pescado
5007018~Steamed Uku Laulau with Ginger-Scallion Sauce~1346~44~20~9~122~6406~7~Steamed Uku Laulau with Ginger-Scallion Sauce Laulau is the traditional Hawaiian method of wrapping salted fish in taro and ti leaves and then steaming it in the imu. Later, the method was used for salted pork. In this recipe, we get much the same effect using ti leaves in a steamer. Like other snappers, the delicate flesh of the uku is best steamed. The Chinese-style sauce gives the perfect finishing touch without overwhelming the subtle flavors of the fish.
5007019~Risotto~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~A creamy risotto might make a main course, but for this Italian dish of braised veal , you might want to bend the rules of one dish cooking to be able to serve a traditional Italian-style side dish. Making risotto is not demanding—you can make it with ease while the veal shanks are braising.
5007020~Vanilla Chai Cupcakes~2859~561~364~87~94~3223~0~Anybody who knows me knows that I have a soft spot for cupcakes and soy chai lattes, so combining these two creates my own piece of heaven. These cupcakes are moist, tender, and lightly spicy, thanks to the combination of ginger and cardamom. Go ahead and pair with a steaming hot chai latte...you won’t overdo it.
5007021~Maverick Grits~2983~173~11~111~206~6434~687~"""On a recent visit to Charleston, South Carolina, I was greatly taken with the grits served at the restaurant Slightly North of Broad, on East Bay Street,"" says Charles C. Gordon of Ontario, Canada. ""Is it possible to get the recipe?"""
5007022~Penne with Meat Sauce~1684~282~20~85~18~2680~145~Highly recommended!

5007030~Spanish-Style Fried Chicken With Grilled Avocado~6250~239~106~436~163~3812~1212~Inspired by Spanish flavors, this fried chicken from chef Suzanne Goin of Los Angeles' A.O.C. gets a spicy boost in both the marinade and the seasoned breading. At A.O.C., Goin serves the dish with a romesco aioli. For a similar sauce, combine equal parts romesco and mayonnaise.
5007031~Cauliflower and Brussels Sprout Gratin with Pine Nut-Breadcrumb Topping~7245~186~33~334~629~11247~1795~Humble cauliflower and brussels sprouts become luxurious in this decadent gratin.
5007032~Marinated Skirt Steak~3164~143~59~334~127~17250~871~In this recipe, a long marinating time allows many powerful ingredients to penetrate the skirt steak: the acid in balsamic vinegar and Worcestershire sauce doesn't just flavor the meat; it also breaks down connective tissues, making the meat tender. Serve this with tabbouleh salad or stewed tomatoes.
5007033~Pasta with Tomatoes, Artichokes, and Feta Cheese~1968~320~34~46~61~60~0~"""For me, cooking is a very relaxing and creative process — I just wish I had more time for it,"" writes Katherine Burk of Seattle, Washington.

5007037~Ribollita with Italian Sausage~4242~389~82~173~197~15231~460~A classic ribollita is cooked one day, then reheated and served the next. To do that, just hold back the last croutons so they keep their crunch.
5007038~Watercress, Jícama, and Orange Salad~1025~125~60~8~55~29~0~Highly recommended!
5007039~Roasted Red Pepper, Almond, and Garlic Dip~1172~64~12~27~91~924~0~The Spanish sauce known as romesco is usually high in fat; this version contains less oil, but just as much flavor.

You'll find lots more Mod Oz recipes in the May issue of Bon Appétit.
5007043~Grilled Asparagus and Spring Onions With Lemon Dressing~559~14~9~3~56~201~0~Fat asparagus stalks won’t fall through the grill grates—and they can char without becoming soft and stringy.

5007045~Roast Heritage Turkey with Bacon-Herb and Cider Gravy~5334~464~266~78~351~10276~701~A bacon-herb butter goes under the skin before roasting, which infuses the turkey with flavor. Be sure to get started at least one day ahead.

5007049~Green Bean Salad with Tuna Sauce and Olives~838~17~7~23~72~926~30~The tuna sauce for this salad is based on the Northern Italian tonnato— a summer sauce served over chilled veal roast. You could use light tuna, but white tuna makes the sauce a more attractive color.

5007057~Fried Chicken with Bacon and Pepper Cream Gravy~8017~280~59~150~795~3998~233~Fried chicken in the South has many variations. Here, a buttermilk marinade helps keep the meat tender and juicy underneath crisp, golden skin; pepper-speckled gravy and bacon add savor and smoke.
5007058~Sweet Potato Pie with Three-Nut Topping~5535~818~408~67~214~12895~905~We've added a topping of walnuts, hazelnuts and almonds to a southern favorite.
5007059~Smoked Baby Back Ribs with Hoisin-Honey Glaze~980~209~148~23~2~15075~0~To make these slow-cooked ribs, the barbecue is used as a smoker. The instructions given here are for a standard 22 1/2-inch Weber kettle barbecue. Grilling times and vent adjustments will vary with different brands. The only special equipment needed is a charcoal chimney, which is available at most hardware or home-and-garden stores. Marinate the ribs a day ahead.

5007062~Chocolate-Almond Cupcakes with Fluffy Coconut Frosting~5694~715~389~176~329~4706~887~These little gems stirred up our childhood memories of coconut-filled candy bars. We baked them in extra-large muffin cups to make them more like little individual cakes. If you choose to use regular-sized muffin cups, the recipe will yield 24 cupcakes and the cooking time will be shorter.
5019048~Crunchy String Bean Salad with Red Onion and Prosciutto~1879~53~38~34~178~6379~94~Chef Michael Schlow of Boston's Via Matta created this dish for Epicurious's Wine.Dine.Donate program. Serve with Schlow's Red Snapper with Black Olives, Capers, and Tomatoes.

5007065~Corn-Pancetta Puddings in Corn Husk Baskets~1989~118~43~57~158~3654~789~"These savory puddings work as a brunch or side dish, with their corn husk ""handles"" making them look like cheerful sunflowers. After you remove the kernels from the cobs, you scrape the corn milk from the cobs with the back of a knife, then simmer the cobs in cream and milk. This mixture forms the base of the pudding batter, which you pour into corn husklined muffin tins. The result is part corn muffin, part soufflé."

5007069~Four-Cheese Focaccia~4001~379~7~344~242~8577~610~Highly recommended!
5007070~Fat Rice~4064~619~105~76~120~7549~138~"If paella escaped from Spain, sailed to China, and did some soul-searching along the way, you'd have arroz gordo, the namesake dish at Chicago's Fat Rice. The generous pot of aromatic rice, curry-scented chicken, and (much) more can be traced back to Macau, the former Portuguese colony in China, where it's almost always served at home. Chefs Conlon and Lo took inspiration from foreign-language cookbooks; their version is a blend of Portuguese and Chinese cooking that Conlon calls ""the original fusion."""
5007071~Salsa Criolla~888~72~17~52~63~2483~71~This lively salsa is typically served with Argentine asado—beef, pork, or lamb cooked over an open fire or grill. It's also wonderful with a seared skirt steak.
5012850~Miso-Rubbed Turkey with Turkey Gravy~522~113~24~41~12~7614~0~Using miso on the turkey is a great way to get wonderfully moist meat — always a challenge at Thanksgiving. The skin doesn't get as crisp as it would without, but we think the succulent results are well worth the trade-off. The miso won't give the turkey an Asian flavor, but it will add a rich meatiness to the gravy. Don't use a brined or kosher turkey for this recipe or the bird will be too salty (miso has a high sodium content).
5007073~Golden Raisin and Apple Lattice Pie~4601~793~335~54~138~1454~378~Cool the apples thoroughly before filling the crust (warm apples could soften the lattice).

5007090~"Beet Ravioli with Pine Nut ""Goat Cheese"" Rosemary-Cream Sauce, Aged Balsamic Vinegar"~8013~215~68~136~802~5871~0~I made a beet ravioli dish for the restaurant menu when we first opened, and it remained popular for quite some time. Our regulars weren't at all happy when we finally took it off the menu. On special occasions, such as Valentine's Day, we've brought back variations on that beet ravioli, sometimes using cookie cutters for hearts or other sweet shapes. If you can find them, candy-striped beets are beautiful and unique, or try using golden beets, or even a combination of all three.
5007091~Duck Fat-Potato Galette with Caraway and Sweet Onions~3674~683~139~67~65~23002~126~Duck fat and potatoes are a match made in heaven in this rustic, savory galette (bacon fat makes a fine substitute).

5007098~Cranberry Chutney With Orange, Figs, and Mustard~2468~571~550~7~27~762~0~If using frozen cranberries, which are just as good for this recipe, don’t bother thawing them first.

5007104~Pear Pie with Red Wine and Rosemary~8276~1516~745~305~185~9806~439~Kierin Baldwin's pie dough method is special in a couple of ways. First, she uses a combination of butter, which lends rich flavor, and shortening, which makes the flakiest crusts. The best of both worlds. Her technique of repeatedly flattening and stacking the dough coats the flour with fat, which helps make the crust tender.
5011611~Dried Chile Salsa~230~45~5~0~3~7306~0~"This smoky, fiery concoction is inspired by Bar Amá's ""Bus Driver"" salsa."
5007107~Caesar Mayonnaise Dressing~2146~56~3~38~197~2956~353~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5007115~Black Bean Tacos with Corn Salsa~2069~369~32~78~19~5094~10~Where's the beef? Who cares? The spiced beans in these festive folds contain fiber, a blood sugar regulator that fends off cravings, as well as protein, which builds lean muscle.

5007123~Cornbread with Bacon Crust~5562~984~88~149~109~5141~548~Crumbled bacon makes an irresistible top crust on this slightly sweet cornbread.
5007124~Scallops With Herbed Brown Butter~732~13~1~72~39~721~203~"Ask for ""dry"" scallops at your fish market; they are free of preservatives and release very little liquid while cooking, which is key to getting a good crusty sear."
5007125~Fresh Tomato-Olive Sauce~1623~83~28~6~140~1611~0~For the best flavor, use very ripe tomatoes and don't refrigerate the sauce. Toss it with pasta, spoon it onto baguette slices, or use it as a topping for grilled chicken, seafood, or tri-tip.

5007130~Marblehead Soft Scrambled Egg, Corn, and Cheddar Cheese~183~0~0~12~13~171~383~I named this for Lloyd Kramer, a regular customer and a onetime pretty famous reporter, now director, who's from a suburb outside Boston called Marblehead. Lloyd is on a healthy diet now, but before that, when he ordered what he wanted, this is what he ate. It has a ton of cheese in it. The frozen corn cools down the eggs, allowing me to cook them over a higher fire than I normally cook scrambled eggs and still have really creamy eggs.
5007131~Chicken and Andouille Sausage Ragù~2362~154~21~121~116~7979~466~This hearty winter stew has rich, deep flavors that improve if the stew rests in the refrigerator overnight. what to drink: Rioja, Syrah, or any medium-bodied red wine with soft berry fruit and some spice.
5007132~Coffee-Spice White Chocolate Truffles~3576~440~325~46~210~1365~238~Set the truffles in paper or silver-foil candy cups, and offer them in baskets wrapped in clear cellophane and tied with raffia and pinecones. If you prefer, coat the truffles in 12 ounces of melted bittersweet chocolate instead of white chocolate.
5007133~Crispy Chicken Salad with Citrus Dressing~870~150~1~27~10~6706~370~Highly recommended!
5007134~Todd English's Backyard New England Clam Bake~10723~1194~253~652~372~32036~841~"Todd English — the chef/owner of Olives and the four Figs restaurants, all in and around Boston — was named Best Chef in the Northeast by the James Beard Foundation. He's also the author of two cookbooks. For his ""clambake"" extravaganza, you'll need a grill with a lid."
5018410~Arugula-Stuffed Leg of Lamb with Roasted Spring Vegetables~2112~279~49~37~78~3598~9~Lamb is a classic at Easter, particularly leg of lamb. Increasingly, though, lamb legs are sold boned, or even better, boned and butterflied, which makes them ideal for summer grilling. But for Easter, a boneless lamb leg (readily available at the big-box stores) becomes something irresistible to stuff, and because there's no bone, it's a dream to carve.
5007138~Apple and Quince Crisp with Rum Raisins~9183~1908~1451~61~180~969~379~If you've never cooked with quince before, here's a great intro. It tastes like a cross between an apple and a pear.
5007139~Guinness-Brined BBQ Lamb Steaks~5274~529~441~294~234~18712~1103~Guinness, the Irish stout, gives the brine for these simple barbecued lamb steaks much of its punch. Like most dark beers, Guinness has a bittersweet molasses flavor, which is great with lamb. But the hidden power of a Guinness brine is its alcohol content (about 4 percent). Alcohol accelerates the absorption of flavorful components directly into the protein structure of meat, yielding a steak that not only retains about 10 percent more moisture, but also is able to deliver a hit of seasoning with every bite. The flavors of chipotle chiles and cumin in the brine are reinforced with a smoky rub and a dark, pungent Guinness BBQ sauce. A word of warning: the sauce burns easily, so only brush it on the meat at the very end of grilling. In fact it is more flavorful served as a table sauce, although the steaks do look nice varnished with glaze.
5007140~Root Vegetable and Farmers Cheese Galette~3600~333~33~172~245~29330~613~This large galette takes root vegetables to the next level. The creamy leek filling and pastry crust make it substantial enough to accompany a few cocktails, and the presentation is sure to impress. Though it requires a few steps, you can make this tart well in advance. Once assembled, just pop it in the freezer wrapped in plastic. On the day of, there's no need to defrost—just brush the tart with egg wash, sprinkle with sea salt, and bake.
5007141~Marmalade Chicken~231~46~35~3~0~1983~0~Highly recommended!
5011210~Mushroom Soup~1067~116~39~42~48~28478~74~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5007266~Caramelized French Toast with Cinnamon and Berries~1834~179~136~32~103~1060~633~"Brown sugar and butter form a caramelized crust on the French toast. Use a light-textured bread; for a special touch, top with mascarpone (see ""Ingredient Tips"")."

5007269~Lime Fool with Strawberries and Kiwi~2203~262~213~14~122~336~346~Fools are light desserts made of fruit and whipped cream. They date back to the fifteenth century. White chocolate gives this classic a contemporary twist.
5007270~Jeweled Rice with Dried Fruit~5162~881~215~84~132~17575~214~Here, you only boil the rice briefly before combining it with the dried fruit and cooking it without water. We adapted this rice from a Persian method that yields a buttery crust (called tah-dig) on the bottom of the pan — later the crust is served with the rice. Usually you have to dip the pot in cold water at the end of cooking to release the crust, but a happy kitchen accident occurred when we tested this recipe. Food editor Ruth Cousineau let the rice stand for almost an hour (things can get hectic when you're preparing a holiday meal), and the crust came right out without the dipping. Using a heavy pot helps keep the rice hot, too.
5007271~Coconut Lime Squares~1977~295~293~12~88~624~584~Highly recommended!
5007272~White Bean, Tomato and Goat-Cheese Pizza~2109~419~26~70~12~5207~0~It doesn’t look or taste like it, but this pizza is low-fat. Each slice has just 346 calories and 4 1/2 grams of fat.

5007274~Sour Cream Chocolate-Chip Cake~5057~715~490~126~273~4127~626~Holidays in our home were strategic missions. We had a plan, everyone had a job, and in a perfect world, we would somehow deploy the food from a cleaned kitchen to a set table, complete with ice in glasses, by 5:30 p.m. Time was scarce. To compensate, my mom had a collection of simple coffee cakes that were quick, had enough chocolate to qualify as desserts in my family, and didn't contain walnuts (as they bother her mouth).
5007275~Spiced Ruby Lamb Shanks~1461~184~125~41~63~15276~85~Browning the lamb shanks helps seal in the juices when they braise.

5007284~Salmon in Saffron Mussel Sauce~1350~37~3~64~82~1832~448~Make garlic-rubbed baguette toasts for mopping up the sauce. What to drink: Brut Champagne or a dry, aromatic white wine, like Viognier.
5007285~Lime Angel Food Cake with Lime Glaze and Pistachios~3167~775~590~38~0~679~4~Finely grated lime peel, a tangy lime glaze, and crunchy pistachios brighten up this old-school favorite.

5007288~Smoked Salmon Smørrebrød~1275~163~27~60~39~4528~116~"Smørrebrød only sound complicated. ""You can put whatever you want on them,"" says chef Nicolaus Balla, who serves the Scandinavian open-face sandwiches at San Francisco's Bar Tartine. Simply slather a creamy spread like butter or sour cream on dense rye bread. Top with classic combos like roast beef and crisp onions, or smoked salmon and scallions—and since they're on view, make sure they look good. Finish with herbs, lemon zest—anything, really, except a second piece of bread."
5007289~Milk Chocolate Mousse Cake with Hazelnut Crunch Crust~4321~438~195~54~285~1077~1073~Layers of chocolate mousse made with gianduja, the luscious Italian hazelnut-flavored milk chocolate, and chocolate genoise top a base of hazelnut crunch.

5007290~Chocolate Cream-Cheese and Lemon Cream-Cheese Frostings~6563~1059~998~20~244~1397~650~Highly recommended!
5007291~Apple-Raisin Bread Pudding~2128~357~301~33~63~1032~520~Minus the ice cream, this delicate pudding makes a wonderfully indulgent breakfast.
5007292~Wild Mushroom and Arugula Crostini~915~150~10~31~8~5071~0~Baked egg roll wrappers make a crisp, low-fat base for the roasted mushroom topping.

5007301~Braised Broccoli with Olives~1047~60~8~1~88~1689~0~Broccoli needn't only be cooked fast until bright green and al dente. In fact the flavor is amplified when it's braised slowly until as tender as can be. You can enjoy this as a vegetable side dish, spoon it over garlic-rubbed bruschetta, or toss it with pasta and freshly grated pecorino or Parmesan cheese.
5007302~Mustard Chicken~679~44~8~1~50~978~63~Highly recommended!

5007309~Mesclun and Cherry Salad with Warm Goat Cheese~2009~86~10~99~147~2356~75~Warm goat cheese rounds are a lovely contrast to the cool salad. Halved cherries add a fresh, sweet flavor.

5007313~Zucchini and Red Pepper Enchiladas with Two Salsas~3506~217~89~21~284~1192~149~Smoky grilled vegetables—not a cloying amount of meat or cheese—rule here. Instead of embellishing the enchiladas with a complex (and time-consuming) Mexican pipián (pumpkin-seed sauce), cook a few customary pipián ingredients and then purée them with cilantro for an easy enchilada that's herbaceous and fresh.
5007314~Roast Chicken with Rosemary-Garlic Paste~386~45~6~0~18~1825~0~When shopping for a chicken, look for the organic seal. An organic chicken will be juicier than one that's conventionally raised. In this recipe, the chicken is butterflied for quicker cooking.
5007315~Broccolini-Cheddar Melts~1610~75~7~73~115~3495~310~A relatively new item in the produce section, broccolini is a cross between broccoli and Chinese kale. It has a milder, sweeter taste than broccoli. Buy German potato salad, and braise red cabbage to serve warm with the open-face sandwiches. Gingerbread and chunky applesauce make a perfect finale.
5007316~To Make Lobster Oil~8491~90~90~4~946~381~0~Highly recommended!
5007317~Butternut Squash and Apple Soup~1483~310~117~26~26~4608~63~"Antoinette Muto of Los Angeles, California, writes: ""My business partner and I own a company that makes costumes for the film industry. When we are involved in a huge project — as we were with Minority Report and X2 — we work very long days, and sometimes even on weekends. So I don't have much time to cook or even to go out for lunch or dinner. That's when my no-fiddling cooking style comes in handy. I cut corners when I can — without sacrificing flavor. I prepare all-vegetarian meals, using the freshest ingredients from the farmers' market, and I really get a kick out of seeing people come over to my house and not miss the meat one bit."""
5015154~Baja Fish Tacos~1964~117~4~38~159~1357~71~Highly recommended!

5019261~Grilled Lemons, Baby Artichokes, and Eggplant~76~18~3~3~0~96~0~Grill the vegetables once the chickens have finished cooking. Because the artichokes have been precooked, it takes just a few minutes to finish them on the grill.
5007324~"Pineapple ""Salsa"""~498~108~64~3~0~0~0~"This ""salsa"" is actually a sort of fruit salad, but it does contain the quintessential salsa ingredients, lime juice and jalapeño peppers. The jalapeños are certainly unexpected, but they have an interesting way of intensifying the sweetness of the pineapple."
5007325~Tofu Scramble with Yukon Gold and Sweet Potato Home Fries~1150~61~8~85~61~2228~0~We like to whip up this delicious tofu scramble with home fries made from Yukon Gold and sweet potatoes on lazy weekend mornings. Begin to cook the scramble just as the home fries are nearly browned to perfection so you can serve this hearty and soul—satisfying breakfast all at once. It tastes and looks great when accompanied by salsa or chopped tomatoes and a handful of garden—fresh herbs.
5007326~Coriander Pork Tenderloin with Carrot-Ginger Sauce~538~40~29~27~30~394~58~Oysters on the half shell with a cold sauce of vinegar, peppercorns and finely chopped lemongrass would be an elegant appetizer. Accompany the pork with the rice timbales , steamed snow peas and baby corn, and a dry Gewürztraminer. End with a salad of melon and pineapple with toasted coconut.

5007334~Rosemary-Crumb Beef Tenderloin with Pancetta-Roasted Tomatoes~2611~310~53~72~114~3505~50~A beef tenderloin roast is a boon for the host and a treat for family or guests during the holidays. Many big-box stores sell them at a reasonable price, and when trimmed, there's no waste—just solid meat. Cooking the roast doesn't tie up your oven for long, and once it's done, it couldn't be easier to carve. Between the green of the rosemary and the red of the grape tomatoes, the sauce is festive with color and loaded with bright flavor.
5007335~Orange-Currant Scones~3146~687~152~78~0~3457~0~These scones are terrific with butter and honey or marmalade.

5007338~Chilled Cinnamon-Ginger Tea (Soojong Gwa)~721~159~159~0~0~0~0~"Although this is a chilled beverage, it is traditionally enjoyed in the winter. The ""fire"" of the cinnamon and ginger is supposed to warm you up, while the coolness of the beverage balances the heat. Not being much of a traditionalist, I like to make it during the summer and keep pitchers of it available as an alternative to iced tea."
5007832~Roasted Cauliflower~236~0~0~0~27~484~0~Blasting cauliflower florets in a hot oven concentrates their natural sweetness, turning them into something akin to vegetable candy.
5007340~Pasta with Capers, Garlic, and Bread Crumbs~1142~38~0~2~110~680~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5007343~Sort of Sephardic Sweet Potatoes and Squash~3122~468~126~47~119~9202~90~Sephardic Jews from Turkey, Greece, Morocco, and other countries of the Mediterranean region say seven special blessings over seven different symbolic foods at their Rosh Hashanah dinner. Five of these blessings are over vegetables — apples (candied or dipped in sugar or honey), leeks, beet greens or spinach, dates, and zucchini or squash. These blessings symbolize their hopes for the New Year. Many of these Jews trace their ancestors back to Spain, which is called Sepharad in the Bible. Over the centuries, the Sephardic Jews took advantage of the abundance of vegetables available in the Mediterranean countries, often throughout the year. Among these vegetables are sweet potatoes and squash, great favorites of my family. The special blessing you can say over your sweet potatoes and squash at the beginning of your Rosh Hashanah dinner goes like this:
5007345~Shark and Bake~1445~85~1~79~86~894~372~"""Shark and bake,"" a popular Trinidadian pocket sandwich, is found at beach shacks and street stalls throughout the island. Part of its appeal is the variety of go-withs, from mango chutney to sliced cucumbers. ""Bake"" is a catchall term for several types of bread, grilled or fried."
5020012~Mushroom Stock~1629~72~6~32~127~4326~0~Highly recommended!
5014594~Garlic Broth~285~33~0~0~13~0~0~This is really a base for other soups that can also be served on it's own — but consider adding some jalapeño pepper, cilantro, and lime juice; or diced tomato, chopped parsley, matchsticks of zucchini, and thinly sliced basil; cooked peas and small leaves of spinach; lemongrass, curry leaves, and lime juice; or any other seasoning group that seems enjoyable.
5007350~Roasted Almonds with Rosemary Fleur de Sel~3008~91~29~115~259~3342~4~If whole blanched almonds aren't available, substitute whole raw almonds with skin on.
5007351~Tofu Triangles in Creamy Nut Buttter Sauce with Scallions~749~74~42~19~40~4727~20~Here triangles of tofu are panfried, simmered briefly in half the nut butter sauce, and garnished with slivered scallion and sesame seeds. The rest of the sauce can be spooned over brown rice, noodles, or whatever you choose as an accompaniment. If possible, present the tofu in the pan that it's cooked in.
5007352~Spiced Shrimp and Red Onion Sauté~538~11~7~21~43~304~194~This fragrant dish would be great served over couscous.

5007355~Ceciarchiata Taiglach~3446~387~180~99~230~3079~370~"Taiglach (little pieces of fried dough dredged in honey) are eaten for celebratory occasions like Rosh Hashanah, Sukkot, Simchat Torah, Chanukah, Purim, weddings, and births. Ceciarchiata means ""chickpeas"" or ""little bits"" in Italian. This festive taiglach is similar in nature to the French croquembouche, though it's a crown, not a mountain. It is a spectacular centerpiece with its clusters of dough and nuts, and is totally addictive."
5016214~Apricot Honey Cake~3443~642~355~132~114~4375~370~"""One thing I cannot get out of my head"" said Ben Moskovitz, owner of Star Bakery in Oak Park, Michigan. ""Was the food better growing up in Czechoslovakia or were the people hungrier there? My mother made a honey cake for the holiday, and it was so delicious. Honey was too expensive for us, so my mother burned the sugar to make it brown. Here I use pure honey, but I still think my mother's cake was better and I know I am wrong. The taste of hers is still in my mouth."""
5007357~Okra with Scallion, Lime, and Ginger~2484~388~13~42~89~1158~23~Steaming unlocks the succulence of okra. Here, the pods are tossed with slivered ginger and a Vietnamese-inspired scallion oil in an all-purpose dish that's great with grilled steak or chicken, or with nothing more than a fragrant bowlful of jasmine rice.
5013068~Plum Glaze~1079~256~220~9~0~2982~0~A glaze lacquers and flavors the bird.

5007362~Spice-Crusted Rack of Lamb~4257~401~266~220~209~13920~797~A small coffee or spice mill makes grinding the whole spices very easy. Serve the lamb with the Indian Ratatouille and basmati rice. Pour a spicy red wine such as Syrah or Zinfandel.

5007369~Kim’s Black-Eyed Pea Dip~1605~15~7~71~138~3193~425~I’m sort of a snob when it comes to trying new recipes. I just seem to like my old tried and true ones best, and it takes a lot for something new to grab my attention. I had to have the recipe for this dip after I tried it on Super Bowl Sunday 2006. Garth is a die-hard Steelers fan, so it was an exciting day. Everybody always brings something for the party, and this was my friend Kim’s contribution. Being a good southern girl, I love anything with black-eyed peas in it, but for you folks who are right now turning up your noses at the idea of eating black-eyed peas, all I can say is just try it. In fact, maybe I should name it something else for those skeptics. How about Pea Dippy?
5007370~Pork Tenderloin Stir-Fry with Tangerines and Chili Sauce~581~49~28~23~31~2642~45~A tangerine's skin is so thin that when it's cooked, you can eat the fruit—peel and all. Asian sweet chili sauce is an orange-colored, slightly spicy bottled Thai sauce; it's available in the As ian foods section of some supermarkets. Chinese five-spice powder can be found in the spice section of most supermarkets.
5014356~Mango Curd~1005~140~137~9~46~199~130~Use this exotic curd as a filling for the Mango-Banana Cake or for mini tartlets.
5018991~Cream Cheese Frosting~2868~591~591~0~69~0~189~Highly recommended!
5007373~Chestnut and Sausage Stuffing~2626~41~21~102~222~6063~1029~We've combined two holiday heavy hitters — chestnut stuffing and sausage stuffing — into one delicious dish. We call for bacon in addition to fresh pork to bring in a bit of smokiness.
5007374~Red-Flannel Salmon Hash with Poached Eggs and Coriander Hollandaise~2751~112~16~45~229~2355~993~Highly recommended!

5007376~Quinoa with Celery and Mushrooms~1384~266~10~38~15~6073~14~"I can just hear someone shouting ""Oh, no, not quinoa again,"" but this is really good. I made it for friends who cannot eat onions or garlic. Looking around for a solution, I found that the freezer had two plastic containers of Boletus mushrooms that I had picked, cooked, and frozen in the summer. If—as is probable—fresh Boletus are not available, use another good mushroom. Even if you don't forage as I do, you will find an expanding selection of flavorful mushrooms in shops—labeled ""wild"" only to differentiate them from regular mushrooms. They need not be frozen. In fact, they will need to be defrosted if frozen.
Don't worry if this makes more than you need. My friends took home the remains, and so will yours."

Big chunks of sun-ripened tomato and soft leaves of butterhead lettuce—Boston or Bibb, for instance—are topped with a creamy blue cheese dressing (fine-tuned with a wizardly touch of bacon fat) and plenty of crisp homemade bacon bits. It is a familiar yet striking kickoff to a bucolic meal seriously focused on produce.

It's light and fresh, with vegetables and flaky fish poached in a perfumed broth. Five-spice powder is a Chinese spice blend combining equal parts cinnamon, star anise, clove, fennel, and Szechuan peppercorns, and can be found these days in most well-stocked grocery stores. A spa meal without the sacrifice, the chewy udon noodles and bok choy soak up that brothy flavor and round out this quick meal perfectly. Who said eating well was hard work?

5007400~Harissa~882~77~29~9~54~40298~49~Harissa, the basic flavoring agent in Tunisian cuisine, is extremely versatile. Use it as a condiment for grilled meat or fish, add it to roasted vegetables, or stir into stews and soups. We particularly like it with couscous or rice. Adjust the amount of heat by increasing or reducing the number of chiles. Just remember, it is meant to be hot!
5007401~Pasta with Shrimp, Tomatoes and Garlic~1215~178~15~49~24~472~198~"A fusion dish from Phyllis Vaccarelli of Let's Get Cookin', in Westlake Village, California. The flavors are basically Italian, but before cooking, the shrimp are coated with a ""velveting"" mixture of cornstarch and egg white used in traditional Chinese cooking, which helps keep the shrimp tender. Serve a watercress salad with balsamic dressing alongside. For dessert, construct a sundae with vanilla ice cream, diced mangoes and crushed amaretti cookies."

5007412~Beef, Vegetable, and Wild Mushroom Soup~3922~299~156~258~199~84519~553~This soup gets a rich, earthy flavor from dried porcini mushrooms, which are available in the produce section of many supermarkets and at Italian markets and specialty foods stores.

5007414~Grilled Glazed Steak and Asparagus~1089~48~22~128~42~5494~306~The glaze, which goes on the asparagus as well as the steak, has a rich sweetness that is transformed into something wonderfully complex once it hits the heat of the grill.
5007415~Veal Chops with Saffron Orzo and Tomato Sauce~2195~306~16~51~75~2337~81~This dish is a summery variation on the Northern Italian pairing of tomato-braised ossobuco and saffron-flavored risotto. Here the delicious classic combination is lightened up with orzo and wilted grape tomatoes.
5007416~Goat Cheese and Green Onion Pan Soufflé~404~9~4~16~32~1396~460~Steamed artichokes would be a great beginning.

5007420~Halibut with Vegetables and Parsley~1900~292~72~33~66~8426~0~"Despite its name, the ""hot ajvar"" called for in this recipe from Zov Karamardian, of Zovs Bistro and Bakery in Tustin, California, is fairly mild. If you cant find ajvar, a substitute can be made by pureeing a seven-ounce can of drained roasted bell peppers with two tablespoons of tomato paste and two tablespoons of purchased chili-garlic sauce, which is available at most supermarkets."
5007421~Curried Vegetable and Tofu Couscous~1169~159~104~32~52~1752~0~There are many packaged side dishes on the market, but we particularly like curried couscous. Here, it becomes a main course. Serve with: Warm flatbread and spinach salad with citrus vinaigrette.

5007424~Yams with Spiced Sorghum Butter~1713~4~4~0~185~0~506~If you can't find sorghum syrup, a combination of honey and molasses works nicely.
5007425~Strawberry and Orange Fools~966~95~93~0~59~11~235~"Fools are traditionally prepared with pureed fruit mixed with whipped cream, or egg custard, or a combination of the two. (The term fool probably comes from the French fouler, meaning ""to crush."") They seem to be especially successful when made with sharply flavored garden produce like rhubarb, gooseberries, and black currants, which still have enough bite to be interesting when blended with cream. But strawberries, which are much easier to find, also work quite nicely. Strawberry fool is best when the fruit is mashed rather than pureed, resulting in a more appealing texture. Serve it with cookies."
5007426~Twice-Roasted Sweet Potatoes With Hot Honey~807~88~70~3~48~316~136~This recipe embraces the incredible natural sweetness of sweet potatoes but gives it a spicy edge.

5007428~King's Cake~1698~272~134~84~115~2453~869~"The King's Cake (galette des rois), in whatever form it took, with a ""bean"" baked into it, has been the king of desserts on Twelfth Night, also known as the Feast of Kings or Epiphany in France, since the Middle Ages. In those days, the French King's Cake took different forms depending on the region. It was a brioche topped with candied fruits in Provence, a flat galette with cream in the North, a dry cake in Lorraine, a puff pastry round with an almond flavored filling in Lyon. À Paris, it was a gorenflot, a sort of enriched bread raised with baker's yeast, something like a Polish brioche. The ritual of this shared cake is symbolic of the day of the Epiphany, commemorating the presentation of Jesus to the Magi on the sixth of January, but it is also redolent of other pagan traditions linked to the cult of fertility that was so popular with the Romans. The ""bean"" hidden inside the cake was originally an actual lima bean, a symbol of renewal and fecundity, before it was replaced by a tiny porcelain figure representing the Christ child, then by a host of trinkets."

5007433~Tropical Fruit Compote with Mango Sorbet~1367~236~292~11~0~750~0~This eye-catching fruit mélange also includes kiwi, which isn't tropical but is very colorful and refreshing. Using store-bought sorbet makes this even easier to prepare.
5017253~Tender Pie Crust~2730~576~55~70~0~3396~0~Based on a classic pâte brisée, the buttery French pastry dough used for making pies and tarts, this pie crust dough is easy to work with and wonderfully versatile.

Pallouras of Rochelle Park, New York, writes: ""My husband and I recently traveled to Cincinnati, where we dined at Daveed's at 934 in Mount Adams.

5007442~Herbed Jasmine Rice~736~141~0~11~11~0~31~Here we've cooked the rice like pasta—a method that can be applied to any long-grain rice (preferably not converted). As for the fresh herbs, we used lemon thyme and chives, but take advantage of whatever you have on hand.

5007446~Chicken-Cranberry Hash~1934~260~104~76~84~4243~220~This is great as is, but if you like, top the hash with a poached egg. Either way, have sautéed spinach and seeded breadsticks on the side and hot fudge sundaes afterward.

5007448~Beefsteak Bismarck~1209~150~68~55~45~4888~126~Highly recommended!
5007449~Crispy Cucumber Soup~1992~369~202~88~0~47577~37~Once the soup is processed, the addition of extra yogurt adds a creamy texture. The diced cucumber and radishes add a crunchy texture. If hothouse cucumbers are not available, substitute the firm garden variety and double the amount called for. Peel cucumbers and halve lengthwise, then seed.
5007450~Sesame Thyme Seasoning (Za'atar)~166~7~0~3~14~969~0~Variations of this seasoning are found all over the Middle East. It's used to flavor eggs and is also served with pita—dunk warm flatbread in good olive oil and then the spice dip. The kind sold dried (with dried thyme) in Middle Eastern stores just doesn't compare to za'atar made fresh.

The recipe makes 4 sizable main-course portions, but the tarts could be halved (or even quartered) to serve as a side dish. Either way, they are delicious with the roasted mushroom and barley gravy."

5007455~Collard Greens and Turnips with Ham Hock and Pepper Vinegar~482~57~11~48~12~6553~95~As all southerners know, eating Hoppin' John—black-eyed peas and rice—on New Year's Day ensures good luck. But it is the collards, traditionally eaten alongside, that bring good fortune! An added bonus to cooking up a mess o' greens is the resultant pot liquor—the delicious, nutritious broth left in the bottom of the cooking pot or serving dish. It is usually served as an accompaniment to that last piece of corn bread.
5007457~Radicchio, Fontina, and Goat Cheese Pizza~1797~77~11~98~115~1868~422~Fresh fennel adds crunch and goat cheese lends tang to this meatless pizza.

5016906~Poppy Cheddar Moon Crackers~1825~152~23~68~125~4912~296~Too often crackers get short shrift as merely vehicles for a slice or smear of cheese. Not here. By incorporating cheese into the dough, along with the tiny crunch of poppy seeds, these crackers become crisp snacks that keep your fingers reaching for another and then another and, well, you know how it goes. In no time, they're history.

Even though these items are simple to use, many people don't venture beyond the package directions. For each contest, I experimented with dozens of recipes, and some of my favorites have been breakfast dishes and desserts. Nowadays I don't enter as many competitions as I used to, but my family still looks forward to my latest creations."""
5007491~Mussels, Clams and Shrimp with Saffron Risotto and Green Olive Relish~761~52~9~43~30~2597~255~A fabulous all-in-one dish, similar to paella, from Lucques in Los Angeles.

5007494~Beet and Walnut Salad~795~14~7~8~79~210~0~This salad has changed the minds of many who previously found beets overpowering. The Sherry vinegar provides a nice accent, though balsamic vinegar also will work. The walnuts may be replaced with pine nuts, pecans, or slivered almonds.

5007497~Bevy of Beans and Basil~1389~178~8~55~44~2284~0~This textural celebration of legumes includes those that are both in and out of pods. You'll find crisp-tender Romano beans and green beans, as well as droves of firm yet creamy fava beans (also called broad beans), which have been a staple in places like Egypt, China, and the Mediterranean for millennia. The beans are all cooked in one pot and then warmed in a skillet, where verdant shreds of basil join them at the last minute for extra oomph. Sound easy? That's because it is.

Use a light colored honey that won't dull the rhubarb's bright hue. If you are using regular yogurt, start this recipe the night before so that it can strain overnight.

5013559~Chopped Spinach with Toasted Sesame Seeds~533~17~0~9~48~112~0~Using a salad spinner makes short work of washing fresh spinach, which usually requires several changes of water. Start by filling the spinner bowl with water. Then fill the basket with spinach, submerge it in the water, and stir the spinach to release dirt. Lift the basket out and repeat with fresh water.

5016684~Coconut Macaroon Sandwiches with Lime Curd~2212~378~295~39~78~1843~222~The problem with Franco-American food trends, like the current one with macarons—those pastel puffs of sweet air that seem to be everywhere—is that its good ol' American predecessor, the macaroon, gets forgotten. The truth is, though, we never stopped loving the coconut macaroon. In fact, we craved its dense, moist chew. Retrofit the macaroon as a bite-size sandwich filled with a pucker-worthy tart lime curd, and you've caught a new trend headed straight for the stars.
5007573~Orange-Glazed Carrot Ribbons~1477~307~261~18~23~969~63~Highly recommended!
5007574~Mashed Potatoes with Herbs~5943~1063~252~115~118~30736~270~This recipe is based on a classic Irish dish called champ. It is typically made with onions or scallions, but we've used chives—and parsley as well. You can create simple variations with parsley or chives alone, or go all out with a combination of sautéed leeks, caramelized onions, and fresh peas.
5007575~Strawberry Icebox Pie with Almond Crust~5523~576~406~70~325~1368~660~An easy press-in crust of ground graham crackers and toasted almonds is topped with a fresh strawberry filling and whipped cream. Chill the pie at least two hours before serving.
5007576~Gorgonzola and Leek Crème Brûlée~2365~50~16~94~203~5457~703~This savory custard features creamy Gorgonzola and the sweet succulence of leeks. Let it precede an entrée of barbecued steak or duck breast for a guest dinner. You can assemble it in advance and bake at the last minute, or bake it ahead and reheat to serve. Finish the dishes with Parmesan cheese for a sharp bite, or sugar for a sweet touch.
5007577~Delicata Squash and Roasted Mushrooms with Thyme~709~0~0~0~82~1454~0~Of all the rich and succulent winter squash varieties, delicata, with its long and uniformly narrow shape, is the easiest to work with. And its thin, pale-golden skin with green striations is more than just pretty — it's edible, too.
5007578~Herb Basting Brush~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5007580~Roasted Pear and Cinnamon Clafouti~657~119~69~17~10~147~370~The French dessert that's known as clafouti is a pancake crossed with a fruit-filled custard. It's best served warm, right from the skillet. If you don't have a cast-iron skillet, any ovenproof variety is fine. Serve with vanilla ice cream.
5007581~Braised Chicken with Apples and Sage~638~54~36~15~39~3604~93~Highly recommended!
5007582~Pan-Roasted Pork Chops with Yellow Pepper Mole Sauce~1634~245~77~57~37~5539~69~The yellow pepper mole may have lots of ingredients, but the result is a delightfully complex sauce. Golden raisins and white chocolate preserve the golden color of the roasted peppers, and while those may sound sweet, onion, garlic, and tomatillos keep the sauce savory, fresh, and never cloying. At the restaurant we give this a hint of smoked red pepper sauce and cilantro oil and garnish it with cilantro.
5007583~Marbled Mint-Chocolate Pudding~2465~207~164~28~180~2252~515~Highly recommended!

5007586~Linguine with Pancetta, Peas, and Zucchini~3354~452~49~130~116~2632~209~Use a vegetable peeler to peel the zucchini lengthwise into thin ribbons, stopping when you get to the very center where it is all seeds. You can use this same technique with carrots and peel long carrot ribbons, or also choose to use half carrots and half zucchini. The zucchini (or carrots or both) sliced this way also make a light, fresh summer salad when tossed raw with lemon juice, olive oil, and fresh herbs.

5007592~Butternut Squash Soup with Pumpkin Butter~255~31~28~8~7~1735~28~At the first nip in the air, I start looking for fresh butternut squash at farmers' markets, just so I can make this soup. Considered a Thanksgiving classic, this versatile and universally loved soup is simply too tasty to enjoy only once a year. Now that peeled and precut butternut squash is available in grocery stores year-round, you can make this easy three-step—roast, blend, and simmer—soup anytime you like. Like apple or pear butter, pumpkin butter is gently cooked with some sugar until it's smooth and has a buttery texture. Look for pumpkin butter near the jams and jellies in your grocery store.
5007593~Grilled Tuna Burgers with Homemade Rémoulade~2421~110~61~9~220~1541~133~"Self-crowned ""BBQ Queens"" Karen Adler and Judith Fertig have written more than 20 cookbooks between the two of them, including Weeknight Grilling with the BBQ Queens.

5007599~Mediterranean Rice-Stuffed Escarole~2573~187~3~115~150~2080~214~The trick of leaving the base attached to the quartered escarole is one we learned from Lidia Bastianich, and it makes the whole process far less fussy. Studded with plump raisins and crunchy pine nuts, the rice makes for a flavorful filling—perfect for the slightly bitter edge of the greens.
5007600~Tomato Onion Chutney~779~79~46~0~63~5258~110~Highly recommended!

5014522~Grilled Corn with Honey-Ginger Barbecue Sauce~324~13~6~2~30~2142~0~It's hard to imagine anything better than freshly picked ears of corn roasting to golden-brown goodness on the grill. One taste of our Honey-Ginger Barbecue Sauce and you'll be wondering why you ever stuck to plain ol' butter. This sweet and tangy sauce transforms the season's staple produce into a standout, flame-kissed favorite.
5007609~Red Snapper With Coconut-Clam Broth~21~2~0~2~0~3881~0~The fennel seeds turn into an aromatic, crunchy crust on the skin.
5007610~Meatloaf~3166~145~57~233~178~4788~1134~This is the perfect antidote to the Sunday blues, not least because there will be enough left over to pack sandwiches for Monday's lunch. A mix of beef, pork, and bacon ensures meatiness, with Worcestershire sauce, chopped prunes, and cider vinegar added for good balance and occasional suggestions of sweetness. Because the loaf is baked without a loaf pan, there's plenty of well-browned crust to go around.
5007611~Apple-Raspberry Crisp~2839~545~413~15~76~484~189~A fall favorite that's topped with vanilla ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream.

5007613~Hue Noodle Soup~2023~416~221~291~183~14847~967~Called bun bo hue in Vietnam, this is the heartier, spicier cousin to pho, the famous noodle soup.
5007614~Fudgy Peanut Brownies~4142~229~131~60~333~3730~1051~Peanut butter chips and chopped salted peanuts take brownies to a new level. Offer fresh fruit alongside.
5007616~Jessica Alba's Chicken Enchiladas~1824~123~26~77~103~10239~228~Highly recommended!
5007617~Thai Beef with Basil~1182~142~48~39~45~5378~51~Basil is wilted like a leafy green in this stir-fry, then added raw at the end for a double dose of its aromatic flavor.
5007618~Chocolate-Apricot Pie~2805~527~264~43~61~2018~437~Apricots have roughly 60 percent more immunity-enhancing beta-carotene—which can help you fend off colds and flu—than their closest fruit competitor, cantaloupe. Consider a slice sniffle prevention!

5007621~Pork Walnut Stuffing with Squash and Sage~5446~141~39~240~438~6363~864~When we opted to cut out grains from our diet, one of the hardest things to give up was, strangely enough, stuffing—the kind you eat with Thanksgiving dinner. Most stuffing is made with bread crumbs, and that just wouldn't do. So Ryan put a lot of effort into developing and testing more nutritious alternatives, and eventually came up with this—a delicious and more-than-satisfying substitute. When they taste it for the first time, many people want to know his secret. They're shocked when he tells them it's omitting the bread crumbs.

5007639~Roast New York Strip Loin with Garlic-Herb Crust~324~33~0~0~18~7754~0~New York strip loin, also called top loin of beef, is a succulent, elegant roast. If you want a lot of leftovers (they are great for sandwiches), use a seven-pound roast and multiply the seasonings by 1 1/2. Either way, have your butcher trim some of the fat, leaving about 1/4 inch for the best flavor. With this as your entrée, uncork a Cabernet Sauvignon.

5007663~Baked Baby Back Ribs with Lemon Confit Marinade~6396~330~260~291~411~25252~1225~In a classic confit, meat cooks (and is then preserved) in its own fat. Here, lemons cook in their own juices to become the basis for an overnight marinade.

5007667~Tuna Steak Marchand de Vin~1392~150~18~40~61~2771~153~Tuna is delicious when it is cooked like steak with a reduced wine gravy made in the pan.

5007668~Arugula, Fennel, and Apricot Salad~1076~113~52~14~68~88~0~A V-slicer or mandoline is the perfect tool for thinly slicing the fennel. The fresh apricots add a nice sweetness to the salad, but feel free to skip them if they're not available in your area.
5007669~New Wave-New Fave Baked Tofu or Tempeh~771~164~123~4~3~1090~0~I've been doing the previous marinades forever. This new one is first cousin to a good barbecued tofu: piquant, sweet-hot-rich, and scintillatingly tasty. The tofu is baked in the marinade/sauce, which cooks down and coats it, caramelizing them. You'll probably have to soak the baking dish overnight before washing it, but it's worth it. Vary this using fruit juice concentrate instead of honey or sugar, and adding extra ginger, orange zest, or both. For an incendiary smokiness, add chipotle in adobo.
5007670~Mashed Potatoes with Prosciutto and Parmesan Cheese~7477~1134~226~235~205~38798~602~Here are potatoes with Italian flavor.

5007677~Blood Orange Tart with Cardamom Pastry Cream~4293~620~258~76~154~863~443~Look for whole cardamom pods in the spice section of your supermarket or in Indian markets (do not substitute ground cardamom). And if your store doesn’t carry blood oranges, use navel oranges instead.
5007678~Blueberry Shrub~3297~823~764~6~6~264~0~"This has to be one of the oldest porch drinks. My grandmother once told me it was the soft drink of her generation (that, and Coca-Cola, which, with a trace of cocaine in its early days, put a pep in her step). Shrubs make great use of fresh fruits—blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, you name it—and are kept in concentrate form, which, tightly covered, will keep in your refrigerator for a couple of weeks (just whisk it to incorporate the sugar ""foam"" that forms on top). Don't be alarmed by the vinegar; the sugar and water tone it down, leaving it most enjoyable. This could be made into a punch by pouring the shrub concentrate into a large bowl and adding 12 to 14 cups of water followed by ice cubes."

5007683~Vegan Chocolate Tart With Salted Oat Crust~4291~671~167~115~158~3749~39~You don't have to use a vegan chocolate to make this decadent tart—any bittersweet baking bar will be great. But if you want to go dairy-free, reading the label isn't all there is to it.

5007699~Three Pea Stir-Fry~710~84~16~18~25~368~0~It may seem odd that we use frozen green peas, but, sadly, even the best fresh ones can taste starchy by the time they make it to the supermarket.

5007707~Cranberry-Apple Crisp with Maple Syrup~4665~854~363~46~103~484~253~Fresh cranberries are usually sold only from November through January. So freeze a few extra bags to make this anytime.
5007708~Salmon Fillets in Dill-Peperoncini Cream Sauce~917~35~16~23~72~1872~148~Spicy peperoncini peppers cut the creaminess of the sauce on this salmon. Serve Artichoke Bruschetta as a first course, rice and asparagus as side dishes.

Since then, diners have lined up for the casual, pub-like atmosphere and the modern take on comfort classics (burgers, pork chops). One of the most delicious examples? The salty-sweet caramel corn studded with cashews and bits of bacon.
5007721~Chicken and Cashew Stir-Fry~2321~116~20~124~147~4433~414~Highly recommended!

5007727~Chipotle Barbecue Pulled Turkey Drumstick Sliders with Brussels Sprout Slaw~2080~134~42~231~73~6179~908~"Turkey drumsticks do not take kindly to the dry heat of an oven, which causes the meat to tighten up around the bone and tendons. But treat those same drumsticks to a long, slow, moist braise in barbecue sauce, and the meat falls off the bones, revealing tough tendons so numerous, you won't believe it.
Barbecue is a very personal subject for a lot of Americans. Some like it sweet, while others like it tangy, so season the mixture to your taste at the end of cooking. Above all, have fun with these cuties. Serve the sliders alongside the slices of breast and thigh meat at the big meal, or set them out with drinks for game-day fare. They'll disappear fast!"

5007751~Quince Stew (Chorosht'e Be)~3247~264~88~184~156~9797~490~"My mother-in-law makes this stew almost every Shabbat because it is my sister-in-law's favorite! Whenever I buy quinces, I have to hide them because my children love to eat them raw! This fruit is not really meant to be eaten raw…it is meant for jams and stews. I guess my kids must be ""hard-core"" Persians!"
5007752~Braised Chicken With Asparagus, Peas, and Melted Leeks~2613~282~26~95~96~8912~89~Gently cooked in olive oil, delectably tender leeks melt like butter over fennel-scented chicken thighs and snappy green vegetables in this easy spring braise.

5020037~Buttermilk Cornbread with Monterey Jack Cheese~3535~394~60~99~112~6055~614~This cornbread is a little firmer and denser than one made for eating on its own so that it will hold up to grilling and tossing with the dressing for the Grilled Cornbread Salad with Red Onions, Arugula, and Red Wine Vinaigrette.

5007765~Conch Tamales with Jalapeño-Cheese Pesto~12100~1756~136~270~432~9901~382~Unlike most tamal recipes, which use dried corn (masa harina), this one is Cuban-style, made with fresh corn kernels. I've also added a different touch by replacing the traditional pork filling with conch. The flavor and texture proved very popular at Yuca, and it remained on the menu as a fixture.
5007766~Potato Cakes with Leek and Carrot~2914~476~92~71~73~13535~126~Serve these with a salad and some sausage for a hearty main course.
5007767~Roast Rack of Lamb with Madeira-Peppercorn Reduction~489~13~6~0~46~20~126~Begin the meal with a salad of endive, pear and watercress with a blue cheese vinaigrette. The lamb is wonderful with the onion-potato gratin and boiled haricots verts; Côte-Rôtie is the right wine. A French apple tart from the bakery topped with some sweetened créme fraîche makes a nice ending.
5007768~Grilled Halibut with Lima Bean and Roasted Tomato Sauce~510~37~4~17~27~2003~18~Since lima and fava beans have a shorter growing season than most local tomatoes, we've given frozen edamame, available year-round, as an alternative to make this recipe more versatile.
5007770~Glazed Pork Loin with Cilantro and Garlic~1713~350~248~1~27~48836~1~When I was little, I would beg my mom to make pork chops, because she'd top them with this sweet, sticky condiment called Saucy Susan. It's a sort of jam made from apricots, and ever since she first combined the two ingredients, I've been obsessed with how well the fruit goes with pork. Nowadays, I pay homage to the sweet-tart flavor of the fruit by brining the loin in apricot nectar and later building upon the flavors with a glaze made from apricot preserves and lemon.
5007771~Cherry-Berry Lattice Pie~7789~1457~944~82~162~1193~449~There's a touch of lemon in this summer pie.
5007772~Caveman Porterhouse with Poblano Pan-Fry~435~91~10~8~0~1431~0~An homage to the prehistoric pitmasters: giant steaks cooked directly on hot coals. This method gives you a steak that's moist on the inside and pleasantly charred on the outside. Be sure to use hardwood lump charcoal (not briquettes) for this recipe. It will burn cleaner, hotter, and faster than traditional charcoal.
5011911~Sugar Snap Peas with Ginger and Garlic~526~82~18~8~13~380~0~Ginger and garlic give these pea pods a hint of Asian flavor, but we think they're a good all-purpose side dish.
5020065~Fresh Tarragon Oil~946~0~0~0~110~484~0~Beautifully bright green, this herbaceous oil really enhances the anise flavor in the lobster gelées.
5007775~Basic Flour Tortilla~1660~393~0~175~59~1502~0~Highly recommended!
5012013~Toasted Coconut Dacquoise with Orange Pineapple Ice Cream~2822~345~333~29~158~1253~873~Highly recommended!
5007777~Roast Chicken with Mushroom Stuffing and Sauce~2035~333~27~50~48~7540~126~Serve buttered green beans with this, and uncork a chilled Viognier.
5009261~Spiced Pork Tenderloin~291~34~1~0~13~0~0~A baked potato, peas and sorbet are all you need with this entrée, but for a party, dress up the pork with cranberry relish, couscous studded with diced bell peppers and green beans, and a rich almond tart.
5009195~Basic Butter Cookies~2234~433~236~96~78~1431~218~These cookies are absolutely delicious made with regular butter, but they become downright amazing with Plugrá or Land O Lakes Ultra Creamy.
5007780~Radicchio and Haricot Vert Salad with Candied Walnuts~2648~165~91~33~207~719~0~This gorgeous winter salad would go well with the Mediterranean Supper Omelet. The seasoned rice vinegar takes candied walnuts from ubiquitous to inspired.
5007781~Croatian Moussaka~8162~248~41~62~791~4021~560~Tony Kerum's deliciously satisfying version of Croatian moussaka — featuring potatoes in place of the more traditional eggplant — keeps film crews well fed.

5007789~Steak House Creamed Spinach~285~30~9~5~14~2486~59~This recipe is a lower-fat version of a dish Richard remembers from the Blackhawk Restaurant in Chicago.
5007950~Lamb Chops with White Beans and Gremolata~532~95~17~27~1~2512~0~For this recipe, the lamb chops are frenched all the way down to the eye of the meat-which involves completely trimming the layers of fat and thin layer of meat that surround the eye and scraping the bones clean of fat and meat. You may want to have this done by your butcher.
5007792~Fabulous Fig Parfaits~1400~228~183~13~54~332~0~Fresh figs are a wealth of life force, containing thousands of tiny seeds that make them a very virile and hormone-rich food. These delicate fruits are very popular in the cuisines of Europe and the Middle East, where they originated. Feel free to use any sprouted nut in the preparation of the nut kreme; pecans are my favorite.
5007793~Watermelon Daiquiri~223~51~48~0~2~33~10~Highly recommended!
5007795~Mom's Deviled Ham Spread~538~20~15~57~30~4453~158~My mother is a member of a club that meets during the months of July and August on Martha's Vineyard, where we have summered for more than thirty-five years. One season the members compiled a souvenir cookbook, and my mother contributed her recipe for a deviled ham spread that she makes from leftover ham. Like deviled eggs, it's devilishly simple and satanically good. It can be spread on pieces of celery or toast points. Those who do not want to use ham can substitute smoked chicken or smoked turkey.

5007800~Mexican Fiesta Casserole~3124~251~90~145~165~8260~501~My invites to tailgate parties usually come with a condition. I absolutely have to show up with this casserole in hand. Since I can whip it up in about twenty minutes flat using only a skillet and a baking dish, this is one condition I'm only too happy to comply with. Most of the time I make it with lean ground turkey. But you can also swap out the turkey and use lean ground beef. This cheesy baked casserole is packed with Mexican flavor, from the spice of the taco seasoning and tomato salsa right on down to the creamy black beans and sweet corn tortillas. It's seriously tasty, seriously easy, and seriously, it's good for you.
5007801~Shiitake-Beef Stir-Fry~628~56~8~59~13~2999~129~Dried shiitake mushrooms can be found in the Asian foods section of your supermarket. Steamed rice completes the meal.

So there's no need to apologize for serving this beautiful plate of sweet lettuce, slices of good Stilton, and toasted walnuts, along with an excellent vinaigrette that brings out the best in all of them.
5007808~Chunky Date, Coconut, and Almond Granola~4837~584~197~125~226~775~126~Serve this granola with milk and sliced bananas or yogurt for breakfast, or sprinkle it over ice cream for dessert.
5007810~Lamb Tagine with Prunes, Apricots, and Vegetables~1011~201~76~11~18~4917~0~In this recipe, a casserole dish stands in for the traditional tagine. Serve with couscous or an Israeli salad of tomato, cucumber, and sweet onion.
5007811~Fennel and Celery Salad (Dama Bianca)~749~10~8~0~82~485~0~"The inner stalks of celery and fennel, plus soft chunks of mozzarella, add up to a clean, cool salad that's quite striking (the name, which refers to a ""woman in white,"" alludes to its pale hues)."
5007812~Crostini with Roasted Garlic, Goat Cheese and Apple Chutney~3613~679~595~66~72~1894~238~Kari and Brian Chase of St. Paul, Minnesota say that their neighborhood has a great restaurant: 128 Cafe. The last time they were there they tried a delicious appetizer of crisp bread with roasted garlic, goat cheese and apple chutney.
5007813~Spaghetti with Chicken, Sausage, and Pepper Sauce~2227~324~12~83~61~3250~232~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5007814~Campari Affogato With Lemon Sorbet~675~172~141~0~0~10~0~Try this delicious variation on the traditional vanilla-and-espresso dessert.
5007815~Grilled Filet Mignon with Brandy Mustard Sauce~1317~105~70~14~90~9256~166~The bite of mustard and the char of the grill amp up the flavor of tender but mild-tasting filet mignon. Be sure to have all the sauce ingredients ready to go before starting the meat. For perfect timing, add the cream to the sauce while the steaks are resting; they'll be done at the same time.
5007816~Crunchy Asian Chicken Salad~1090~54~24~68~65~3452~300~Kids and adults alike will enjoy this lunch. Store this tasty salad in a wide-mouthed thermal container, use several Bibb or Boston lettuce leaves to wrap around the salad instead of bread, and pack the nuts separately in a little plastic bag for sprinkling. For those who can take the heat, add a splash of Chinese hot oil or hot sesame oil to the salad.
5008211~Summer Vegetable Curry~6511~1077~256~288~58~205443~0~This golden curry cooks quickly, so the vegetables are just tender. A flourish of mint adds the final spark.

5017629~Tropical Cheesecake with Coconut Shortbread Crust~847~52~40~23~63~611~370~The shortbread cookie crumbs will hold together in the pan without any additional butter. Fromage blanc gives this cheesecake a light and silky texture.

5007864~Poached Eggs with Roasted Asparagus, Prosciutto, and Chive Oil~1775~23~15~50~169~4861~444~The chive oil would also be delicious drizzled over salmon or chicken. For very hungry guests, poach 12 eggs and serve each person two instead of one. WHAT TO DRINK: Prosecco, an Italian sparkler, is festive, delicious, and a good value.

5016944~Poblano Chile Sauce~316~44~5~0~12~1638~0~This sauce can be prepared with yellow bell peppers instead of poblano chiles. Both sauces go equally well with the chicken-and they also complement each other nicely.

5007870~Golden-Fried Pumpkin Purses~2164~79~42~79~170~5858~499~"Called ""Uncle Johns"" in the Monegasque dialect (or barbajuans), these little fried pouches are filled with pumpkin, leeks, rice, and Parmesan cheese. Like their Italian cousins — the tortelli di zucca from Lombardy — they are prepared like ravioli, but the similarity ends there. The dough, though not a pasta dough, is very thinly rolled and made with olive oil. The barbajuans are fried to a golden crispiness rather than boiled or baked, and they are served with aperitifs rather than as a first course."
5007871~Pan-Seared Filet Mignon with Red Bell Pepper, Tomato, and Basil Sauce~804~42~26~4~58~1543~158~Try a fruity, spicy red wine, such as a California Zinfandel, with this main course.

5007875~Vanilla Sugar (Vanillezucker)~1774~473~473~0~0~0~0~While you can make a very nice vanilla sugar by simply plunging a vanilla bean into a jar of sugar and leaving it there (for a really, really long time), I actually like to make a slightly fancier version by processing vanilla and sugar together until the bean is all broken down and the sugar is speckled with countless tiny beans and specks of pod. The sugar is more intensely flavored than regular vanilla sugar. Packaged in a pretty glass jar, it also makes for a great gift.
5007876~Grilled Tequila-Lime Chicken~376~66~56~19~0~3590~45~Begin making this one day ahead. If you plan to take this on a sailing trip or a picnic, grill the chicken at home, then transport it in a cooler and serve it cold, or let it stand at room temperature up to two hours. Crusty bread and white wine are perfect accompaniments.
5007877~Grilled Pompano and Shrimp with Lemon, Olives, and Bay Leaves~346~24~3~31~14~569~194~Although bay leaves in this recipe smell delicious and look enticing, they should not be eaten because of their sharp edges.

5015970~Clay-Pot Miso Chicken~2118~300~137~58~66~22999~80~Though this rich, intense, homey stew has the depth of a recipe handed down through generations, it's actually a modern interpretation, by Momofuku partner Joaquin Baca, of a Mexican stew he grew up eating, made with Japanese ingredients. And it's the best kind of comfort food: The dark greens, mushrooms, and burdock, braised with silky chicken in a savory broth, make this single dish feel like a satisfying, well-balanced meal.

5008048~Corn and Tomato Gratin~6703~1075~49~169~195~5325~435~This hearty gratin resembles a savory bread pudding. Tomatoes, aromatic basil, and parmesan cheese give it an Italian flair.

My fiancé had mentioned their love of chocolate and coconut, so I knew I had to dazzle them with a sensational dessert,"" writes Sarah Smythe of New London, Connecticut . ""This cheesecake worked beautifully."""
5008052~Turkey Sausage Patties~616~91~40~44~4~3428~119~These patties get their moistness and delicious flavor from a combination of light and dark meat. We don't recommend using all breast meat—they just won't be as good.
5008053~Winter Melon Soup~433~37~13~26~8~7090~56~From the rich broth to the velvety cubes of winter melon — a gourd commonly used in Chinese cuisine for the wonderfully soft texture it takes on during cooking — this wholesome soup is immensely satisfying. Although the winter melon's delicate white flesh has no distinct taste of its own, it absorbs the broth's flavor. We recommend buying a good-quality organic free-range chicken to get the best results. Since Chinese ham is unavailable in the United States, we substitute Smithfield ham. But other cured hams, such as prosciutto, also work well.
5008054~New-Fashioned Apple Pie~1535~346~307~1~23~24~63~Highly recommended!

5008057~Herbed Clam Hash~1871~263~54~55~62~9816~115~Satisfying accompaniments for this clever hash would be steamed broccoli and a salad of crisp romaine lettuce with red wine vinaigrette and some shaved Parmesan cheese. We recommend serving slices of Boston cream pie afterward.

5008071~Rhubarb Mint Coolers~1778~446~406~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5008072~Peanut Soup with Rice and Scallions~3957~585~65~106~128~3144~23~Instead of white cubes of tofu bobbing in this African-style soup, where they look decidedly odd, I purée the tofu with a portion of the finished soup until everything is smooth. The tofu is there, but it doesn't intrude. And this is a method you can use with virtually any puréed soup. If you wish, you can purée the entire soup or leave it textured, with bits of sweet potatoes and peppers.
5008073~Blood Orange Sorbet~1554~401~330~11~2~18~0~Regular oranges work just as well, but they won't impart the same fiery sunset color.

5008075~Standing Rib Roast, Spinach-Porcini Stuffing, Irish Whiskey Gravy, and Horseradish Cream~3050~84~10~93~252~16181~720~An impressive roast. Irish whiskey adds complexity to the gravy, which was inspired by steak au poivre. Plan to make and chill the stuffing one day ahead. There will be only a small amount of stuffing for each person, but it's so rich and flavorful that you won't need more.
5008077~Pork Rib Chops with Sauteed Apple and Star Anise~934~82~78~18~57~511~144~Highly recommended!
5008078~Creamed Pearl Onions and Fennel with Crispy Spiced Breadcrumbs~2077~262~98~75~83~1923~223~Sweet, tender pearl onions are the stars of this reimagined classic, which gets an elegant update from fennel, citrus, and Parm.

5008081~Asian Steak and Noodle Salad~2476~419~274~55~65~17055~45~It takes bold flavors to stand up to the smoky richness of grilled beef, and this salad delivers. A tangle of rice-stick noodles cradles Asian greens, apples, and mint, and tender slices of flank steak top things off. The finishing touch? A drizzle of sweet dressing tangy with fish sauce and fiery with red-pepper flakes.
5008082~Vanilla Bean-Roasted Figs with Wildflower Honey-Vanilla Ice Cream~3548~329~301~42~222~3044~627~Highly recommended!
5008083~Jerked Pork Chops~1220~224~163~8~14~1960~11~Jamaica's native herbs and spices glorify the lush island's most popular meat. I serve this with Golden Pineapple Chutney . These chops need at least 4 hours' marinating time, and if you can let them sit overnight, they'll be even better.
5008084~Pride of Erin Soup~1247~141~82~37~57~4572~162~Highly recommended!
5008085~Sesame-Crusted Salmon~729~46~16~31~46~1885~40~Sesame seeds have a powerful antidepressant effect and provide the basis for this healthy, restorative dinner.

5008089~Gingerbread Snowflakes~1899~376~7~173~78~3792~218~Highly recommended!
5009620~Orecchiette with Cauliflower, Anchovies, and Fried Croutons~3666~472~71~85~158~1697~120~"The croutons found their way into this dish thanks to the frugality of Italian cooks. ""Puglians don't throw anything out,"" says Donatella. ""Any leftover bread is used in the pasta."""

5008093~Gingered Cranberry and Kumquat Relish~1138~269~269~0~0~233~0~Kumquats lend their bright citrus snap to a no-cooking-required relish.
5014335~Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate-Raspberry Frosting~4076~597~545~18~234~3661~623~An old-fashioned cake gets a new treatment: Some of the trimmed cake crumbs are mixed with chocolate-cookie crumbs and pressed onto the frosting. Fresh raspberries are the colorful crowning touch.
5008095~New Mexican Pork and Green Chili Stew~9859~610~106~634~493~58966~2186~Highly recommended!

5008102~Grilled Sea Bass with Miso-Mustard Sauce~152~38~34~3~0~488~0~An easy dish that uses some traditional Japanese ingredients, including miso. Made from fermented soybeans, miso paste comes in various shades, with the darker ones being stronger in flavor. This recipe calls for white miso (also called shiro-miso), which is sweeter and more delicate.
5008103~Spicy Lobster Pasta~1817~294~20~26~57~131~63~There's something special about lobster you've prepared yourself, but if cooking one on a weeknight isn't your speed, buy cooked lobster or shrimp instead.
5008104~Spice-Roasted Cornish Hens with Cucumber-Yogurt Sauce~392~47~13~8~13~3896~32~The hens roast in about half the time it takes to cook a whole chicken. Offer wilted spinach alongside.
5008105~Chilled Lemon Souffles with Caramel Sauce~647~124~98~16~10~152~370~Silky caramel sauce served with a foamy soufflé makes for an opulent textural contrast. And unlike a warm soufflé that you bake, this chilled version (and the sauce) can be made ahead.
5008106~Sweet and Spicy Candied Pecans~2729~116~60~31~253~1468~0~Highly recommended!
5008107~Basil Flatbread with Roasted Tomatoes and Basil Oil~95~1~0~1~9~1938~0~Here's a popular starter at The American Restaurant in Kansas City.
5008108~Goat Cheese and Tomato Tart in a Cornmeal Crust~3250~267~19~108~225~139485~937~In this recipe we call for a 10 1/2- by 7- by 1-inch rectangular tart pan with a removable fluted rim; you could instead use a 10- by 1-inch round tart pan with a removable rim. The cornmeal makes a tender, delicate crust.
5008109~Cream of Broccoli Soup~614~47~25~15~41~3329~63~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5008110~Apricot and Rosemary Skewers~840~208~159~7~0~464~0~With the neo-eco-bio-cool. We'll pick our own apricots, cut some rosemary from the garden, a little organic honey…
5008111~Grilled Steak and Radishes with Black Pepper Butter~1038~14~7~3~106~1130~253~Double the peppery butter and keep it refrigerated for the next time you're making steak—we guarantee you'll want it.
5008112~Spicy Tofu and Lemongrass Stir-Fry~2630~397~75~163~8~109712~0~Sunday dinner. From Golden Door in Escondido, California. Executive chef Michael Stroot loves this stir-fry because it's a showcase for his garden-fresh herbs and produce. And cooking the dish makes the kitchen smell fantastic. Serve it over fiber-rich brown rice.
5008113~Grilled Halibut and Tomato Packets~662~5~3~0~71~607~0~Highly recommended!
5008115~Black Sesame Noodle Bowl~1026~95~35~22~54~2754~380~For this noodle bowl, I took inspiration from Heidi Swanson’s Black Sesame Otsu in Super Natural Every Day, in which a blanket of black sesame seeds is toasted until it smells heady, then pounded with a mortar and pestle and combined with some Asian pantry staples to make a thick, savory, and tangy dressing, here given a bit more punch with wasabi. Like other cold noodle dishes, this is a good dish for packing up, and in my experience has been wonderful on the beach. The shredded egg and wisps of radish incorporate into the noodles, the shallot brings crunch and zing, and the final drizzle of kecap manis—the Indonesian soy sauce— brings the whole bowl together in the most satisfying way.
5011952~Black Rice with Squid~3606~605~10~130~86~12967~262~Highly recommended!
5008117~Coriander Lime Shrimp~722~38~29~22~56~24791~194~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.

5008130~Frozen Lemon Gingersnap Pie~3786~330~176~29~258~2206~661~This dessert was inspired by the time-honored tradition of serving gingerbread with lemon sauce — the tang of lemon cuts the richness of molasses.
5008131~Rhubarb and Raspberry Crostata~2860~626~349~69~23~2319~9~"""This dough, with its addition of whole wheat flour for a nutty taste and tender texture, is a must in your baking repertoire.""—Karen DeMasco"
5008132~Curried Parsnip Soup with Shredded Apples~3186~182~77~21~279~7500~61~Made with yogurt instead of cream, this pureed soup is deceptively light. The green apple peels, thinly sliced and fried, make a delicious garnish.
5008133~Roasted Carrots and Parsnips with Citrus Butter~1006~131~60~9~50~3302~63~This recipe includes a little citrusy butter melted over the vegetable once they are out of the oven. If you're feeding kids, though, remember that they sometimes prefer their roasted vegetables plain. When carrots or other roots are at their best, that's how I like them, too.
5008134~Iceberg Wedge with Warm Bacon and Blue Cheese Dressing~4547~39~4~120~442~9097~850~The classic combo is back — and bacon makes it better than ever.
5008135~Ethiopian Spice Tea~12~2~2~0~0~0~0~This is more of an infusion than a true tea, since it isn't made with tea leaves. You will have leftover spice tea to store.
5008136~Frozen Meyer Lemon Cream with Blackberry Sauce~1042~45~26~10~96~346~399~Meyer lemons lend a fragrant citrus note to the silky frozen cream, which needs about four hours' freezing time.

5008138~Tomato and Bacon Salad in Bibb Lettuce Cups~907~11~6~31~80~1490~115~The following hors d'oeuvre, a variation on the BLT, can be put together quickly if the ingredients are prepared a few hours ahead and assembled just before serving. Finely diced mozzarella would be a nice addition to the salad filling.
5008139~Chocolate Cake with Caramel-Coconut-Almond Filling~15807~1878~1364~252~856~7307~1481~To many people living in the middle of the country, celebration cakes must be chocolate cakes — especially German chocolate cakes. This one embellishes the tradition, using unsweetened chocolate instead of sweet chocolate, a luscious caramel-coconut filling between the layers and lots of creamy chocolate frosting. (By the way, German chocolate cakes have nothing to do with the immigrants who settled in the heartland; the name actually comes from the fact that the cakes were first made with Baker's brand German's sweet baking chocolate.)
5010648~Roasted Grape Tomato, Orange, and Basil Relish~614~78~38~3~27~87~0~Highly recommended!
5008143~Berry and Tarragon Pavlova~1208~93~62~18~86~824~313~"""I like unsweetened whipped cream on top,"" van Boven says, ""because the fruit is sweet enough on its own."""

5008147~Maple-Apple Pie with Walnut Streusel~5346~901~449~68~168~670~252~Golden Delicious apples, which aren't too sweet and hold their shape when cooked, are a great choice for this pie.
5008148~Mushroom-Poblano Frittata~766~35~5~20~62~1132~398~If you've got a handful of eggs in your fridge, you're halfway to making one of our favorite weeknight dishes, the versatile frittata. We like the earthy combination of peppers and mushrooms, though any combination of sautéed vegetables, herbs, and cheese will work.
5008149~Puerto Rican Crab~1259~146~81~57~45~8524~404~Often found at shacks on the beach in Puerto Rico, this full-flavored crab dish is served in the shell, or with rice and green bananas or plantains. A defining element of the dish is sofrito, a traditional Spanish sauce of tomatoes, onions, garlic, bell peppers, cilantro, and hot pepper.

5017532~Buttery Pie Crust~1632~296~0~140~78~195~218~Here's a tasty crust for a number of pies. Like any butter crust, chill the dough well before rolling out, or it will be difficult to work.
5008166~Vanilla Frosting/Vanilla Sauce~2224~19~11~7~241~109~0~Let's just dive in, shall we? Not only does this produce a thick and creamy vanilla frosting, it also doubles as a whipped topping, and left unrefrigerated it becomes a vanilla sauce to serve with crumbs, shortcakes, or volcanoes. And why stop there? I especially love the sauce on savory bites like corn bread, muffins, and biscuits, where it acts like a decadent sweet butter. If you try to steer clear of soy, replace the liquid and powdered soy with the rice milk variety for both in equal measure—but be advised that the result will taste slightly sweeter. Please note: If it's true frosting you want, be sure to factor in the full six hours for it to chill and set.

5008177~Mashed Potatoes with Cauliflower~2637~508~102~51~35~15155~63~Here, cauliflower lightens traditional mashed potatoes and blends in seamlessly. A touch of butter is all you need to make them rich and sumptuous. Steaming the vegetables instead of boiling them helps preserve their vitamin C.
5008178~Chili-Cornmeal Skillet Pie~1090~154~55~40~32~3550~47~A versatile dish for the family or for casual entertaining. The chili is also good without the cornmeal topping, served with corn bread alongside.

Though many crostatas employ jam, this one gets its zest from fresh cranberries cooked down and paired with an almond-scented crust—and the proportion of filling to crust is our idea of perfection.

5008254~Tortilla Soup with Chiles and Tomatoes~1590~112~16~39~101~9193~207~Tortilla soup is all about contrasting textures, but its real success hinges on a fabulous broth—in this case, homemade chicken stock enriched with a cooked purée of chiles, tomatoes, onion, and garlic.

5008256~Whole-Egg Lemon Buttercream~6902~389~383~17~587~1138~2183~This rich buttercream is lightened and brightened with the addition of lemon curd. The recipe yields enough buttercream to ice a 3-layer 9-inch round cake. For cupcakes, halve the recipe.
5008257~Cranberry-Tangerine Scones~3517~485~118~59~122~2817~362~Highly recommended!
5008258~Kale with Pickled Shallots~911~103~7~32~48~421~0~Gently pickling the shallots mellows them and also adds hints of sweetness and acidity. Tossing them with some earthy, quick-cooked kale makes for a pleasing contrast in flavors.
5008259~Braided Almond-Cream Wreath (Kranzkuchen)~4946~826~456~206~190~2240~119~"If Schlesische Mohnrolle is my favorite thing to buy at Hutzelmann, our favorite bakery in Berlin, then Kranzkuchen is my husband’s. Max has a soft spot for Kranzkuchen, an almond-paste and rum-raisin–stuffed sweet wreath. He has tried many Kranzkuchen in his life, but he says that absolutely none come close to Hutzelmann’s version, sold in thick slabs all year long. It is glorious: sticky and rich, winey with rum and almond paste, chewy, and flaky all at once.
I tried many times to re-create their Kranz (which means “wreath”) at home and never quite got it right, but in the process I developed this recipe, which is pretty darn good. Forming the wreath requires a bit of moxie because once you roll up the almond-cream-filled dough and slice it lengthwise, you have to wrap the 2 strands around each other without allowing the filling to leak too much. After baking, when the Kranzkuchen is golden brown and shiny from the apricot glaze and topped with a drizzled glaze, it’s as beautiful as it is delicious. I suggest you bake this when you have a lot of people to feed at once—it’s best the day it is made."
5008260~Shakshuka (Baked Eggs With Spicy Tomato Sauce)~431~9~3~12~37~156~370~Shakshuka means “all mixed up” in Hebrew and is one of the most popular breakfast dishes in Israel and at Sofra. Many countries in the Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean claim a version of their own, like Tunisian chakchouka, made with peppers and harissa, and a Moroccan version made with lamb sausage and harissa. The eggs are poached directly in the spicy tomato sauce, so it’s important that the sauce is well seasoned and warmed before you add the eggs.

5008271~Curry-Coconut Shrimp~2761~391~9~191~47~5080~1321~Shrimp absorbs the flavors of a marinade rapidly, making this quick entrée ideal for a busy weeknight. Steaming gently cooks the shrimp and reduces the likelihood of overcooking. Regular coconut milk offers the best flavor for this dish, as the taste of light coconut milk is too subtle. I often serve it over brown rice or whole wheat noodles.

5008299~Maple Pecan Pie in Wheat-Flavored Crust~4820~498~414~47~304~684~496~The name Newman was once a staple only in Hollywood; today, it's a staple in kitchens all across the country. That is largely the result of the efforts of two people: Paul Newman, who founded the Newman's Own line of food products in 1982, and his daughter Nell, who expanded the brand with Newman's Own Organics 11 years later. All profits of both companies go to charities.

Pomegranate molasses has this distinct taste. Here I've mixed it with other flavors, but it can be used on its own to enhance a salad, a dip or a savory pastry. The pepperiness of the arugula and the soft buttery eggplant along with the sweet cherry tomatoes are unforgettable.

When Donatella was growing up, her family would put bowls of water and olive oil on the table with the friselle so that everyone could dip their own bread. If friselle aren't available, toasted ciabatta is an easier-to-find substitute.

For this recipe, you'll need to order a U.S.D.A. ""choice"" grade, packer-trimmed brisket: That's a brisket with none of the fat cut off. Before being cooked, the meat is seasoned with a dry rub; during cooking, it is brushed regularly with a beer-based mop. You'll need to use a smoker for the brisket (a converted barbecue won’t maintain the very low heat required), and to get the most authentic Texas flavor, seek out the natural lump charcoal specified in the recipe; it's available at barbecue stores, some natural foods stores and some supermarkets."

5019514~Barbecued Chicken~927~125~106~2~29~5030~0~Avoid rookie mistakes when it comes to barbecuing. If you apply the sauce too early, it will scorch. And most bottled sauces are too sweet, which is where this vinegary version comes in.
5008405~Grilled Tofu and Sauteed Asian Greens~302~46~7~8~4~3230~0~Pressing excess moisture out of your tofu will increase its firmness and its ability to absorb the flavors of the marinade.

5008407~Thai Chicken-Coconut Soup~1218~164~11~46~28~10367~49~Replacing full-fat coconut milk with a light version reduces fat, not flavor.

5018391~Roast Turkey with Herb Butter and Caramelized Onion-Balsamic Gravy~1646~77~66~6~143~13925~378~The gravy can be started while the turkey roasts. When the turkey is through cooking, finish the gravy with balsamic vinegar and the pan juices.

5011046~Orecchiette with Red-Wine Veal Sauce~4282~544~30~221~130~6250~421~Here, meltingly rich veal shanks combine wonderfully with the chewiness of orecchiette, ear-shaped pasta shells made of semolina (coarsely ground durum wheat).

5008418~Grilled T-Bone Steaks with Balsamic Onion Confit~327~57~52~1~11~969~31~There aren't many dishes more satisfying than a sizzling steak with a full complement of savory side dishes. Alex Rodriguez likes his sides tasty and free of unnecessary fat and calories. This slow-cooked confit (a French culinary term referring to an ingredient slowly cooked in its own juices) fits the bill, and leftovers can be refrigerated for the next day. Add some steamed spinach and oven-roasted sweet potatoes as a well-balanced complement to the steaks, and you've got a dinner that knocks it out of the park.

5008423~Lemongrass Pork with Vietnamese Table Salad~2869~372~236~166~86~17151~306~"Great for a summer party, this recipe doubles easily, and most of the elements can be done ahead. ""This dish exemplifies the lively and engaging nature of the Vietnamese table,"" says Mai Pham, ""the ritual of wrapping meats in crisp lettuce with fresh herbs, then dipping them into a zesty sauce."" Provide each person with a little bowl of sauce, as well as the usual plate to make assembly easier."

5008428~Crab With Romaine, Dill Sauce, and Sunflower Seeds~5361~32~19~56~576~3891~306~Sprouting and frying the sunflower seeds completely transforms their flavor. But just using salted, roasted sunflower seeds would also work fine. This recipe is from Staplehouse, America's Best New Restaurant 2016.
5008429~Blueberry Pie with Cornmeal Crust and Lemon Cream~4114~938~364~71~8~1454~0~In this gorgeous pie, blueberry meets its perfect match: lemon.
5008430~Grilled Baby Bok Choy with Miso Butter~742~37~25~0~61~1825~94~BOILING OR STEAMING bok choy often results in a watery, stringy vegetable. But grilling halved heads of bok choy slathered with miso butter leads to pure flavor. Be sure to keep the heat at medium so the paste can caramelize without burning. My first few attempts at grilling bok choy (I used Shanghai bok choy) resulted in charred leaves that were too crisp to enjoy. Now I separate the leaves from the stalks and use them raw in a salad that wilts under the heat of the grilled vegetable. Use white or yellow miso paste in this recipe. If you use a darker miso, know that it will be saltier. Make this side dish when you are already firing up the grill for the main course.

5008437~"Herbed Polenta ""Fries"""~675~0~0~38~56~760~168~"In his ""A Tuscan Son"" menu, Tony Oltranti serves Polenta with Franklin's Teleme as a smooth, soft base for his roast chicken. This recipe takes polenta in a different direction—cooked with sage, rosemary, and Parmigiano-Reggiano, the polenta is then cooled, cut into sticks, and broiled until the outer edges of the ""fries"" are golden and crisp, a fine contrast to the creamy interior. Serve them with a fried egg and a salad for a vegetarian lunch, or pair them with something saucy like chicken fricassee."
5008438~Mixed Greens with Bacon and Herbs~1494~39~3~44~135~1689~115~With bacon and lots of fresh herbs, this salad has a delicious balance of flavors. A warm baguette and a good Cabernet round out the menu.

5008446~Roast Turkey with Apples, Onions, Fried Sage Leaves, and Apple Cider Gravy~1198~304~227~14~0~548~0~Lady apples—a small, hard winter apple that's yellow with a reddish cheek—are often used decoratively but we love them for their flavor. They're widely available in markets this time of year. Said to be one of the oldest known apple varieties, they originated in the Forest of Api, France, during medieval times.
5008447~Eggplant Cannelloni~1357~156~105~25~67~2545~79~Kristine Subido, chef at Wave in Chicago, makes you forget about pasta.
5008448~Quick-Braised Red Cabbage and Apple~1000~164~107~0~34~278~94~A trilogy of apple—cider, cider vinegar, and ample chunks of Gala or Fuji— contributes sweet-tart goodness to this Germanic dish. It's a simple, straightforward celebration of fall.
5013856~Beef Stew with Stout~577~38~20~51~21~1468~162~Colcannon (Mashed Potatoes with Kale ) and steamed asparagus tossed with lemon juice strike the right note alongside this braised beef dish. Rhubarb pie from the bakery is our choice for dessert.
5008450~Sausage, Greens, and Beans Pasta~3041~327~6~159~130~3980~351~The genius of this pasta recipe is in the contrast of the textures and flavors. If spicy isn’t your thing, sub in any fresh sausage you like.

5008454~Toasted Nut Tart~5341~771~477~111~244~3453~626~This rustic tart, filled with toasted pistachios, hazelnuts, and pine nuts, is a wonderful take on pecan pie.

5008456~Eggplant, Red Pepper, and Fontina Panini with Spinach Salad~1804~20~7~113~139~3634~438~This vegetarian sandwich has very little oil—but it's still plenty indulgent, thanks to two cheeses and the sweet grilled peppers. Make it in a panini press or pan, or on the barbecue.
5008458~Mixed Beans with Peanuts, Ginger, and Lime~1894~214~39~49~75~5105~0~This is a high-summer throw together of a sauté to make when there are lots of snap beans at the market. Mix colors and types for the full effect.

5008472~Homemade Croutons~2~0~0~0~0~0~0~"Croutons can be tricky. The store-bought versions are often too large, too salty, and too garlicky. So I prefer to make my own. I usually make several batches of croutons and store them in a resealable plastic bag in the freezer so I'll have them on hand. They taste ""just-made"" for weeks."

5008474~Lamb Chops with Lemon~1296~120~25~0~82~22~0~Serve the lamb with your favorite tzatziki (cucumber and yogurt sauce) and horta (sautéed greens tossed with red wine vinegar and honey).
5008475~Baked Smoked Ham with Mango~250~64~53~2~0~4~0~In this simple recipe, salty, smoked ham is paired with sweet mango and onion. The fruit and vegetables are cooked alongside the ham in the covered roasting pan, leaving them meltingly tender.

5008487~Caper-Rosemary Tuna with Herb Salad~987~21~13~22~93~3585~57~For such a rich fish, tuna is a good team player—it takes well to all kinds of seasoning. Here, I give it some tang by marinating it with lemon juice and zest, onions, capers, rosemary, and the most surprising ingredient: some of the juice from the caper jar. Have fun playing around with the herbs in the salad; just make sure not to toss them with the dressing until you're ready to serve—tender leaves wilt quickly.
5008489~Roasted Peppers with Tomatoes~938~88~31~6~57~433~0~To keep this dish colorful, be sure to layer the red tomatoes inside the yellow peppers and the yellow tomatoes inside the red peppers.
5008490~Lobster Salad with Green Beans, Apple, and Avocado~536~48~19~24~23~18554~40~I first sampled a version of this light and lively salad as a meal at chef Yves Camdeborde's Le Comptoir in Paris's 6th arrondissement. Yves and I participated in the New York marathon in 2006, and I am sure that the strength gained from this protein-rich salad helped me make it to the finish line! This dish has it all: color (the red bits are lobster roe), crunch, and a light touch imparted by a dressing of yogurt and mustard.
5008491~Stir-Fried Sugar Snap Peas and Baby Carrots~235~37~13~6~7~409~0~Chicken broth is combined with oil to stir-fry the vegetables.
5008492~Hurricane~453~106~77~1~4~401~0~Passion fruit syrup can be difficult to find. We located a bottle by contacting a distributor, Fee Brothers. (Call 800-961-3337 or write to info@feebrothers.com) Because the syrup is hard to come by (and artificially flavored) we devised a substitute for it that was well received: a tablespoon of passion fruit sorbet (Häagen Dazs makes one) and a teaspoon of grenadine, per serving.
5008493~Spiced Mango Lassi~1061~325~102~11~2~224~16~This rendition of India's popular yogurt shake makes a cooling counterpoint to any spicy dish.

5008523~Grilled Lemon-Coriander Chicken~851~51~11~0~67~1498~32~Grilling a whole chicken cuts down on prep time and makes for a dramatic presentation. A purée made from fresh herbs, garlic, and chile spread under the skin of the bird keeps the meat moist.

5008531~Apricot, Date, and Pistachio Haroseth~793~198~87~7~0~196~0~Harosetha thick condiment of fruit, nuts, and winesymbolizes the mortar the Israelites used in Egypt. Robertss particular mix of almonds, pistachios, dates, and dried apricots, reflective of the Middle East, is outstanding (note that we prefer the sweet-tart complexity of California/Pacific apricots to the bland sweetness of Turkish ones).

My father said it tasted just like his grandmother's, and I was very flattered. That's basically the story of how I started cooking. After almost a lifetime in the kitchen, I still enjoy playing around with recipes. I've even been known to go out to dinner, taste a certain dish, and then re-create it at home in a few tries."""
5008558~Ode to Halo-Halo~1332~219~162~14~51~308~92~It doesn't get any cooler than halo-halo, the Filipino treat with a base of fluffy shaved ice. Macerating the fruit makes it extra juicy and saucy, but you could just throw in any unadulterated berry. The key to this dessert (as with any sundae) is a mix of textures: icy, creamy, chewy, crunchy.

5013739~Eggplant Napoleon~6885~619~104~161~479~5487~24~One of the most popular items on the Tanoreen menu, this tower of crispy pesto-marinated eggplant slices spread with smoky baba ghanouj, just might be the dish that inspired me to write this cookbook. It draws on the flavors of the Middle East and the Mediterranean, but the truth is, I created it to encourage my son to eat eggplant. He always loved fried zucchini sticks, so I cut eggplant in the same shape and he was none the wiser (although here they're cut in rounds). This is a good example of how I have taken advantage of ingredients that are available to me in the States and married them with the classic preparations from my childhood.

5008569~Snap Beans with Mustard and Country Ham~410~35~15~22~16~2295~55~"To many Southerners, green beans are ""snap beans"" because they ""snap"" when you break them. This recipe, my own, combines three southern favorites: green beans, mustard, and country ham. I like these beans best with roast turkey, grilled or roast chicken. But they're equally delicious with pork chops or roast pork. Some southern supermarkets sell biscuit slices, slim rounds of country ham ready to cook and slip into biscuits. Others sell country ham by the piece or the pound. If it's not available in your area, you can order it from thevirginiacompany.com. Note: Because of the saltiness of the ham, the mustard, and the broth, these beans are unlikely to need additional salt. But taste before serving and adjust as needed."

5008658~Campanelle Pasta with Burrata Cheese, Spinach, Lemon, and Toasted Almonds~3863~346~17~132~223~1801~385~Burrata is a luscious Italian cheese made by mixing cream and unspun mozzarella curds together (for a texture similar to ricotta): the mixture is then inserted into the center of a ball of fresh mozzarella. It can be found in some supermarkets, at specialty foods shops, and at Italian markets. Substitute fresh mozzarella if you can't find burrata.

5008661~Gluten-Free Blueberry Corn Muffins~2816~370~12~40~117~4693~637~This crowd-pleasing recipe was developed by Susan Baldassano, Director of Education at the Natural Gourmet Institute for Health and Culinary Arts in New York City. For moist, tender muffins, use finely ground yellow cornmeal, such as that made by Arrowhead Mills. You can replace the blueberries with an equal amount of cranberries and increase the sugar to 2 tablespoons, or replace the blueberries with 3/4 cup of raspberries.These muffins are delicious on their own, or try them warm with butter and jam. Cooled muffins can be wrapped in plastic and stored at room temperature for up to three days or frozen for up to three weeks. Thaw and reheat muffins in 350°F oven or microwave (unlike those made with wheat, gluten-free baked goods won't get tough in the microwave). See our related story for more information and sources for gluten-free ingredients.

5016371~Hobo Pack Potatoes with Rosemary and Garlic~3836~705~134~67~71~23083~0~These potatoes steam away in the coals while you grill the rest of your meal. If you're not eating them right away, keep them in their foil pouches and rewarm them on the grill or in a 350°F oven before serving.
5008672~Spaghetti with Fresh Clams, Parsley, and Lemon~2841~396~6~32~118~751~0~Lemon juice is an integral part of this classic dish. Choose the smallest clams possible, and make sure not to overcook them.
5008673~Frozen Watermelon Margarita~221~59~59~0~0~0~0~In these margaritas, frozen watermelon takes the place of ice. Blending in the seeds gives the drinks a striking speckled appearance.
5008674~Ceviche of Red Snapper~1016~49~9~23~94~39410~35~"Other seafood may be used in this dish, including scallops, tuna, swordfish, squid, or monkfish. Fish with a relatively firm texture, like that of snapper, is the best choice. Select fish that is perfectly fresh, since the fish is ""cooked"" only by the acidity of the lime juice. Serve avocado slices as an accompaniment, and garnish the plates or platter with additional sliced tomatoes and sprigs of cilantro."
5008675~Apricot-Mustard Baked Chicken~443~108~108~0~0~162~0~This chicken takes about 10 minutes to pull together and then about a half hour of mostly hands-off time in the oven. In theory, you could time things so the chicken is ready as soon as the kids go to sleep. But if you can't for the life of you figure out a way to steal the few minutes needed for prep while the kids are awake, then just take care of step 1: Preheat the oven.
5017406~Bibb Lettuce Salad~156~16~9~2~9~857~0~Salade de Laitue
5008677~Wild Mushroom Soup with Vegetable Confetti~5162~81~20~350~369~4256~1443~The stock recipe yields 8 cups; there will be about 1 1/2 cups left over after you make the mushroom soup.
5008678~El Chupacabra Martini~918~178~142~6~23~277~32~"Translated into English as ""the Goat Sucker,"" El Chupacabra is a mythical creature known for its nocturnal prowling and as the culprit in weird livestock deaths. There are various descriptions of the creature, which is believed to be heavy, the size of a small bear, with a row of spines stretching from head to tail. Maybe you've heard the silly stories. My fascination with this mythical creature inspired me to invent a drink as its namesake. This martini is infused with fiery red blood orange juice and the explosive Brazilian aphrodisiac açaí, making this an exotic bright red cocktail full of drama and flavor. Açaí juice is actually very healthy and has 33 times the antioxidant content of red wine grapes. Hints of guava and pineapple nectar in this drink are fruits from Puerto Rico (where Chupacabra sightings were first reported). The understated tones of coconut rum make this drink equally dangerous, so sip with caution."

5008685~Pigs in a Blanket~867~71~15~34~50~3248~94~Along with shrimp puffs and the ubiquitous nut-coated cheese ball, some version of these tasty bites was all the rage at 1950s cocktail parties. They haven't lost their allure—just some fat and calories—in this slimmed-down incarnation that swaps reduced-fat hot dogs and crispy leaves of phyllo for the traditional fat-laden cocktail sausages and crescent-roll dough.
5008686~Herbed Potato Salad with Lemon-Olive Oil Dressing~4078~733~147~79~81~24815~0~A nice side dish for a casual picnic or for a fancier meal with grilled chicken or seafood.

5008697~Crispiest Potato Chips~2397~504~100~50~12~15131~0~Keys to great chips: A lower frying temp gets the moisture out; a vinegar soak ensures they're crisp.
5008698~Baeckeoffe / Laundry Day Stew of Beef, Pork, and Lamb~9767~1629~439~347~182~45652~643~"This is the stew that made such an impression on the final episode of the first season of Top Chef Masters. Each of us had been asked to create a meal that would be an autobiography told through the dishes we would present to the judges. I immediately thought of baeckeoffe (""baker's oven""). The name refers back to the time when bakers used wood-fired ovens. After the bread was done, this dish would be baked long and slow in the falling temperatures of the cooling oven. Since everyone in town would see the baker every day for the family's daily loaf, each would often bring a casserole to be baked in the oven. It was traditional, particularly on Mondays, when the women went to the river to do their laundry. They would have marinated their meats and vegetables overnight, dropped their casseroles off in the morning on their way, and then picked them upplus a loaf of breadon their way home. Even though my father was not the bread baker and had a modern, gasfired oven, people still took their casseroles to him. They liked to drop in because he always had some joke or story to tell. Before the village baker also invested in a modern oven and was still using wood, when my father turned over a fresh loaf of bread to give it the traditional blessing, he would sometimes see pieces of charcoal embedded in the crust. That would send my dad wild, muttering that ""he [the baker] did not thoroughly clean his oven!"""
5008699~Frozen Lemon-Ginger Yogurt~2229~170~168~0~157~2~629~A light, refreshing and tangy-sweet dessert.

5008701~Roast Chicken with Rhubarb Butter and Asparagus~1480~95~79~2~119~10~253~Talk about a spring chicken. The sour-sweet rhubarb butter seasons and bastes the meat as the bird roasts.

5008703~Sweet and Savory Pine Nut Relish~545~54~33~9~31~1089~1~Here's a tangy condiment for holiday entrées; try it with pork tenderloin, roasted chicken or turkey. Begin preparing the relish a day ahead to allow the flavors time to blend.
5008704~Pot Roast in Rich Gravy~2196~474~33~58~15~4040~0~Brisket is the centerpiece of many holiday tables, but pot roast, cooked to succulent tenderness in a full-bodied braising liquid brightened with the tang of wine and tomato and enriched with a heady trio of cinnamon, bay leaf, and thyme is just as special without sacrificing tradition.
5008705~Grilled Shrimp and Vegetables with Pearl Couscous~5583~819~214~133~185~8619~593~This riff on traditional pasta salad gets an added layer of flavor from golden pearls of toasted couscous.

5012506~Fresh Pasta Squares~1189~209~0~48~20~1164~4~It's important to make this tender fresh pasta into pansoti as soon as you have cut the dough into squares: The squares dry out quickly and become difficult to seal.
5008710~Sour-Cream Pancakes with Sour-Cream Maple Syrup~1425~140~32~61~94~2910~175~When food editor Lillian Chou was faced with creating a recipe to use up the scant cup of sour cream left over from our Ravioli with Green Beans and Prosciutto , she immediately thought of pancakes. She knew that the sour cream would act like buttermilk to produce a very tender texture. But the eureka moment came when she thought to combine some of the sour cream with maple syrup and butter for a topping. The result is the color of café au lait, with the tang of sour cream playing off the syrup's deep sweetness.
5008711~Almond Tart with Stone Fruit and Lime Meringue~7391~728~607~144~441~2884~496~Yes, it's a long recipe with several parts, but each step is easy enough, and it can all be made ahead.

5008713~Brown Rice Salad with Crunchy Sprouts and Seeds~1614~242~88~33~53~3197~166~Toasted seeds and nuts add bite to this nutrition-packed salad. We use dried sprouted legumes, which are even more healthful than ordinary beans and more convenient than sprouting your own. (Cooked lentils and mung beans work well, too.) A vibrant chive vinaigrette brings it all together.
5008714~Feta, Garbanzo Bean, and Eggplant Pita Sandwiches~1100~147~38~29~45~1308~52~These good-for-you sandwiches are low in fat and meatless.

5016914~Cauliflower Soup with White Truffle Oil~420~29~11~6~26~1545~63~The truffle oil is not essential, but it's a nice indulgent touch. Since the oil's flavor dissipates with heat, add the oil to this first-course soup just before serving.

5008725~Watermelon Mint Cordial~406~99~79~0~0~0~0~Watermelon in its solid state is so loaded with water and sugar that it is little more than a beverage waiting to be released from captivity. This tangy, refreshing drink is the fulfillment of that promise. The addition of a little vinegar does much to expand the aroma of the watermelon, which is barely perceptible when youre eating the fruit. Mint and watermelon are natural BFFs. If you were unaware of that relationship before tasting this recipe, afterward you will try never to serve a slice of watermelon without a mint sprig somewhere nearby.
5008726~Rosemary-Roasted Lamb with Pan Juices~666~41~3~0~55~3877~0~Ask your butcher to bone and butterfly the leg of lamb. Begin marinating one day ahead.

Sharp and pungent when raw, mustard cabbage sweetens and mellows with wilting and slow cooking. Try serving this dish with mashed potatoes, which go very well with the gravylike tomato sauce the stuffed cabbage is cooked in.

5008735~Crunchy Turnip, Apple, and Brussels Sprout Slaw~396~37~21~4~27~40~0~This slaw reimagines Brussels sprouts as an adorable mini salad green. Core them with a paring knife and the leaves will pop right off.

5008739~Sage and Garlic Grilled Tomatoes~482~37~3~2~32~96~7~Tomatoes are great for grilling. The searing heat caramelizes the tomato's natural sugars. Tomatoes readily absorb the flavors of herbs and other seasonings, and their shocking red color looks terrific on a plate along with grilled poultry, seafood, or beef. The tomatoes can be grilled on any sort of indoor grill—for that matter, you could also smoke them in a stove-top smoker.
5008740~Braised Endives with Haricots Verts~187~5~5~0~17~858~47~A mix of pleasantly bitter and crisp-tender vegetables perfectly complements the Duck with Walnut Sherry Vinaigrette . Some of the nutty, sweet vinaigrette will inevitably end up on the vegetables, enhancing their flavor.
5008741~Smoky Shrimp, Hominy and Tortilla Soup~1134~90~36~105~43~8697~880~The tortilla strips need to dry overnight, so begin making this one day ahead.

5008743~Black Barley, Fennel, and Radish Salad~801~144~25~11~0~199~0~Mixing visually striking black barley with raw and cooked vegetables creates lots of flavors and textures. Feel free to substitute the more readily available pearl barley instead.

5018242~Canal House Teriyaki Sauce~1570~359~338~26~0~14036~0~Breakfast is just the beginning. Use this in stir-fries, to marinate tofu, or to glaze chicken as it roasts.

5008756~Whiskey Peppermint Flip~175~21~20~9~3~241~17~Flips were originally hot drinks made with egg and a variety of liquors and wines. They were warmed up by means of a loggerhead, an iron tool with a long handle and bulbous end that could be heated and plunged, like a poker, into the drink. Today, however, flips are generally served cold. Historically, they have been most often served in the morning or at bedtime, because of their soothing character.

5008765~Rose Beef Bites with Horseradish Cream~630~82~14~16~25~1310~70~I insisted that the theme of my coming-of-age party be mocktails and canapes because I wanted to be grown up, and had often seen my mum eat canapes at parties. My Rose Beef Bites are delicate and also delicious, with beef and horseradish being lifelong friends. Spending a tiny amount of time to be sure the beef looks pretty makes these canapés stunning to behold. Assemble the beef before the party, so then it's only a matter of spread, drop, serve, and smile!

5011927~Fresh Green Salsa (Salsa verde cruda)~249~49~5~1~1~3226~0~Tart and fiery, this classic bright-green salsa shows off the flavor of tomatillos and the lovable grassy sharpness of fresh unripe chiles. Serve it with anything that would benefit from lively contrast, such as Chopped Fried-Fish Tacos .
5008770~No-Bake Chocolate and Cream Cheese Pie~2451~411~386~12~90~392~195~Garnish with whipped cream and chocolate shavings for a lovely presentation.
5008771~Easy-Does-It Granola~14115~1736~377~450~629~3043~214~Unlike many store-bought granolas, this luxurious blend of oats, green pumpkin seeds, and exotic dried fruit is preservative-free and not overly sweet. Sprinkle it on yogurt, pancakes, or waffles—or simply enjoy eating it out of hand.

5008773~Pineapple Anise Sherbet~64~13~11~0~0~0~0~Our food editors find the texture of pineapple sherbet so much lighter and fluffier than that of other sherbets and sorbets — it practically has the weightlessness of granita.

It's one of the flavors we were developing for our ""Dictators of Cool"" collection, which included our old favorites Adolf Hitler (The Great Licktator), Colonel Gaddafi (Cone El Gaddafi), and David Cameron (Fake 99, after a British ice cream cone)."

5008780~Turkey Ramen~3399~336~63~156~157~15748~564~"Edward Lee, executive chef and owner of 610 Magnolia, in Louisville, Kentucky, shared this recipe exclusively with Epicurious. Known for blending Southern and Asian flavors, Lee uses the leftover turkey carcass to make a stock infused with country ham, ginger, garlic, and daikon radish. The richly aromatic stock forms the broth for Lee's ramen bowl, which he fills with tofu, avocado, watercress, scallions, shiitake mushrooms, soft-boiled eggs, and leftover turkey meat. Freshly grated Parmesan is the final, unexpected garnish. ""It adds umami to the dish,"" says Lee, adding, ""it disappears into the broth and adds a depth and nuttiness."""
5008782~Spring Vegetable Ragoût~6761~1133~166~326~124~14880~214~One of the very best things about this stew is its practical nature: If you blanch the vegetables, boil the potatoes, and make the infused broth a day ahead, this dish takes only 15 minutes to cook.

5008784~Coriander Chicken Tostadas with Refried Beans and Grilled Fennel~1371~88~23~29~105~1985~45~"Sue Torres puts a creative spin on Mexican flavors at her Manhattan eatery, Sueños. According to Torres, many people overcook chicken breast because they're worried about salmonella. ""You're not killing bacteria, folks —you're killing flavor and moisture,"" she says. Because it is easy to overdo the heat with the lean white meat, it's worth using an instant-read thermometer to check for doneness (the thickest part of the breast should reach 165°F). What to pair with that perfectly cooked meat? Torres has an idea. ""Chicken works well with so many seasonings , but coriander gives it a tuxedo,"" she says ."
5008785~Coconut-Pecan-Crusted Brownies~2786~213~129~47~216~1858~649~Unlike the topping on German chocolate cake, which is soft and gooey, the coconut-pecan crust on this cake-like brownie is baked, making it crisp.
5008787~Green Bean Casserole~353~50~33~11~5~1217~21~"""Au gratin"" is a term that, in America, is usually associated with cheese. But the term may refer to any light but thorough topping of fine fresh or dry bread crumbs or even crushed cornflakes, cracker crumbs, or finely ground nuts on scalloped dishes or casseroles. These dishes, usually combinations of cooked shellfish, fish, meats, vegetables, or eggs, bound by a sauce and served in the dish in which they were cooked, are then browned in the oven or under the broiler to form a crisp golden crust. Set the casserole dish or baking dish on a piece of foil, shiny side down to deflect the heat, or just set it on a baking sheet."
5008788~Heirloom Tomato Herb Pasta Salad~2298~378~46~62~61~4690~0~Spontaneity is the key to this pasta salad; it's not something you can make ahead and chill. The main ingredients can be harvested from a backyard plot or balcony pot, or simply be a reward for your produce-shopping prowess at the farmers market.
5008789~3-Ingredient Cacio e Pepe (Pasta With Cheese and Pepper)~4180~377~0~200~225~10137~526~"In Epi's 3-Ingredient Recipes series, we show you how to make great food with just three ingredients (plus staples like oil, salt, and pepper).

5008814~Tadka Dhal~1523~164~115~6~77~41035~10~This is probably the most famous lentil dish coming out of India—yellow lentils tempered with spices and the usual holy trinity of garlic, ginger and chile. It has always been a favorite of mine and it would grace our family dinner table at least once a week when I was growing up. There are lots of different recipes for flavoring the oil (tadka), so play around with your spice pantry and see what you come up with. If you don’t have half of these spices, then don’t worry; just add a tablespoon of your favorite spice paste and it will taste just as delicious.

5008835~Sichuan Pepper-Salt Roast Chicken~337~9~3~15~28~5033~62~Sichuan peppercorns are a wonderful ingredient to have on hand—they lend such an unusual fragrance and flavor to foods (and not just savory foods; check out chef Raquel Carena's Mocha Mousse with Sichuan Peppercorns). In China, cooks traditionally toast the peppercorns to release their aroma and then grind them together with salt. Juicy roast chicken liberally rubbed with this spice blend makes a universally appealing dish.

5008848~Roast Heirloom Goose with Balsamic Vinegar~233~50~9~1~0~0~0~"To save a step, rather than making the Balsamic Pan Sauce , drizzle an aged artisanal balsamic vinegar (12-year-old ""vecchio"" or 25-year-old ""extra vecchio"") over the carved portions of the goose. This recipe must be started at least a day ahead."

5008902~Caribbean Christmas Pudding with Brandy Butter~8987~1403~730~118~307~2755~1009~Rum and spices-classic Caribbean ingredients-also happen to be the classic ingredients in the traditional English steamed pudding. This lovely version of the Christmas dessert is from the Grand View Beach Hotel, Villa Point, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Begin preparing it at least one day before serving.
5008903~Chicken and Herb Potstickers with Mint-Chili Sauce~4153~235~101~84~336~8407~581~Highly recommended!

5008908~Mussels with Coconut Curry Sauce~530~12~8~0~25~3478~63~Mimosa in Los Angeles uses coconut milk in this version of a Breton classic.
5008909~Sweet-and-Sour Balsamic-Glazed Spareribs~2071~508~468~0~1~6293~4~I love a recipe like this, in which one familiar item (balsamic vinegar) combines with something else very familiar (in this case, the elements of a homemade barbecue sauce) to form something entirely new. The end result, which gets slathered all over spareribs that have been slow-roasted in the oven and baked at a high temperature until the two entities combine, makes for a sticky, tangy, unforgettable take on good old-fashioned ribs. If you're feeding a crowd, the oven is your best bet for that final step; if you have the time, though, try broiling the ribs with the glaze on top. The rib and the glaze fuse together and, if you take it far enough (just before it turns black), you get a crispy, sweet, and succulent rib that'll be your new standard from now on.
5008910~Rustic Lemon Tart (Torta Della Nonna al Limone) With Pine Nut Lace Cookies~6918~622~239~159~508~11649~1004~While the crispy, buttery lace cookies add addictive crunch to this dessert, they're not mandatory. The citrusy creaminess of this Italian-style lemon tart makes it an impressive finale all on its own.
5009428~Bacon Scallion Hush Puppies~14139~262~24~90~1490~4925~150~If you make these as a side dish for the southern fried catfish, you can fry them in the same oil, but cook the hush puppies first because the fish will flavor the oil.
5008912~Grilled Porterhouse Steaks with Olive and Caper Spread~649~30~0~0~67~4449~0~Highly recommended!
5016171~Bittersweet Chocolate Truffles~3206~285~221~30~244~1049~587~This classic truffle is made from a simple bittersweet ganache. Adding a few special ingredients makes these truffles anything but ordinary - for variations see balsamic truffles, mango curry truffles and meyer lemon and thyme truffles
5008914~Rice with Almonds and Raisins~1123~171~18~24~39~1149~21~Highly recommended!
5008915~Bacon Baklava~7143~557~523~109~510~3458~904~How can those delicate layers of pastry and nuts possibly be improved upon, except with bacon? Phyllo dough can seem scary at first but once you understand that the sheer quantity of layers will mask the flaws of any individual sheet, you will gain confidence. Orange flower water and rose water are available at gourmet shops and Mediterranean markets.
5008916~"Spicy Tuna ""Tarts"" with Stuffed Tomatoes"~1071~73~13~35~70~4111~40~Editor's note: This recipe is part of a healthy and delicious spa menu developed exclusively for Epicurious by CuisinArt Resort & Spa on Rendezvous Bay in Anguilla.

5008919~Rosemary Portobello Burgers~755~105~23~63~24~1364~54~Offer deli-bought orzo salad tossed with slivered basil and Kalamata olives, along with some grilled red pepper quarters. Raspberry gelato in sugar cones would be a cool dessert.
5008920~Shellfish and Potatoes à la Marinière~3246~494~90~199~67~25959~463~White wine and briny shellfish juices marry in the pot, then are puréed with parsley to create a light sauce so flavorful, it needs only a touch of butter.
5008922~Garlicky Greek Salad~1461~33~13~35~140~3052~142~Highly recommended!
5008924~Buttermilk Rye Crepes~1724~117~26~60~67~878~507~Yes, you could serve these crepes before they've been caramelized in sugar, but why deprive yourself?

5008930~Grilled Beef Skirt Steak With Onion Marinade~1575~59~5~167~66~8238~435~This is one of those recipes that will make you look like an incredible cook for very little effort. Because of skirt steak’s relatively loose grain, it soaks up marinade incredibly well and is one of the few meats we ever marinate before grilling.
5008931~Valrhona Chocolate Cherry Cake~3537~433~354~35~187~906~651~Highly recommended!
5008933~Bacon-Wrapped Quail Stuffed with Goat Cheese~3024~48~15~127~269~6820~536~These tiny birds, stuffed with creamy goat cheese, make fun yet elegant turkey stand-ins. Since the quail are small and there's not much meat on each one, plan on serving guests two to three per person, and encourage them to chew the meat off the bones rather than trying to cut it off with a knife and fork.
5008934~Katy's Dates with Ancho Chili Oil~2608~148~74~31~209~952~23~I first met Katy Sparks in the flesh at New York City's French Culinary Institute. We were both there to teach on a mentorship program, and since I was already wild about the food at her restaurant, Quilty's, I made a beeline for her and insisted we become friends and spend lots of time eating together. For fun, Katy and I have given several cooking classes working as a duet; she made these dates at our first class together. They are just the kind of thing I find irresistible — sweet, crunchy, juicy, spicy — you name it, they've got it. Once you have the ingredients, they're very easy to put together.
5008935~Tomato Soup with Lemon-Rosemary Cream~1139~57~16~6~90~5860~283~Here's the real thing — far more vividly colored, textured and flavored than the stuff that comes out of a can, and far more comforting. A drizzle of lemon-rosemary cream gives this classic American soup an Italian touch.

5008942~Tomato-White Bean Soup with Pesto~1375~131~17~34~68~4443~0~We usually turn to fish for omega-3 fatty acids and their brain-enhancing powers, but walnuts are a great vegetarian source of the nutrient.
5008943~Pound Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream and Apple Cider Sauce~6063~836~690~37~283~2271~750~The rich, creamy sauce is also delicious on crisps, puddings and cobblers.
5008944~Summer Berry Crisp~4033~768~481~69~109~0~253~Juicy berries are marvelous nestled under a crispy top. This dessert is easy enough for a beginning baker to make and serve with pride.
5008945~Pasta Salad with Roasted Eggplant Gibb~1816~209~9~15~110~30617~0~Highly recommended!
5008946~Peas with Baked Ricotta and Bread Crumbs~1106~73~33~33~71~2138~155~Faced with a cup of just-shucked peas, my mind runs in a million directions. Should I simmer them with soft butter lettuce leaves, pair them with pasta, or flatter their delicacy with new sage leaves and their blossoms, fresh mint, or lemon (or even all three)? Basil is lovely with peas, too. I could add them to that meager handful of fava beans that are waiting for company, or use them to make a frothy green soup. After scanning the possibilities, I end up cooking them with minced shallot, sage, and lemon, then spooning them over baked ricotta with crispy bread crumbs. This is one of my favorite dishes.
5008948~Roasted Salmon and Olive-Mustard Butter and Orzo~920~13~6~0~92~1016~253~Highly recommended!
5008950~Grand Fruit Salad~2452~623~435~24~2~36~0~Here's a colorful and delicious addition to a brunch menu. It also makes a lovely light dessert on its own.
5008951~Vinegar Sauce~1273~288~239~2~3~4440~10~When coming up with a vinegar sauce for Fette Sau, I didn't want something that was too obviously connected to any specific regional barbecue. (North Carolina 'cue employs a sauce that's either vinegar and spices, in the eastern part of the state, or the same with the addition of tomato, in the west; South Carolina adds mustard to its vinegar sauce.) And I wanted a vinegar sauce that would work equally well with all kinds of smoked meat—not just the pork it's usually paired with. This sauce will add brightness to pulled pork, and it has enough depth to stand up to beef and lamb.
5008952~Barbecued Pork Sandwiches with Pickled Red Onion~1722~104~18~25~133~4911~54~Instead of pork shoulder, this southern-inspired recipe uses quicker-cooking pork tenderloin. For fullest flavor, look for Berkshire pork or another heritage breed. Smoked salt in a grinder can be found in the spice section of most supermarkets.
5008953~Three Onion Soup~1107~115~31~41~46~4577~105~Highly recommended!
5008955~Buttermilk-Lemon Chess Pie~5216~697~492~113~249~2203~1002~Tangy buttermilk and fresh lemon juice balance the sweetness in this custardy Southern pie.

5008972~Peach-Blueberry Ice Cream Pie~3729~400~301~18~229~1090~1070~The only trick to this fruit-flecked pie created by Sweet Rose Creamery in Santa Monica, CA, is making sure it gets 6 hours in the freezer to firm up.

5008974~Cheese Tortellini Soup with Cannellini, Kielbasa, and Kale~2633~95~14~132~203~12960~493~For a change of pace, use purchased tortellini filled with pumpkin instead of cheese.
5008975~Creamy Tarragon Eggs~553~8~5~14~48~377~485~Our ten–minute Crab Salad isn't the only easy way to use tarragon. Here, the fragrant herb, along with a dollop of cream cheese, adds elegance to scrambled eggs. Don't relegate this wonderful dish to the breakfast table—served with a small green salad and a glass of white wine, it makes a delicious weeknight dinner.
5008976~Cheddar Cheese and Onion Pie~2028~484~47~158~95~8781~520~English farmhouse-style white Cheddars such as Montgomery, Keen's, and Fiscalini were delicious in this pie. We also liked Grafton Cheddar, from Vermont.

5008984~Spicy Shrimp and Bell Pepper Stew with Cumin and Oregano~1589~104~31~159~57~2183~1321~Cubans call this delicious stew enchilado, and while that might sound a lot like enchilada, the two dishes are nothing alike.
5008985~Baked Red Snapper with Fennel-Scented Tomato Sauce~331~11~5~0~30~1263~0~Buy an apple tart for dessert.
5008986~Fried Rice with Ham, Egg, and Scallions~4036~785~14~120~41~4575~142~"The egg in this fried rice is cooked by a super easy method. Rather than being made like the classic egg ""crêpe,"" the egg is cooked right in the well of the rice, which creates a much more delicate texture."
5008987~Slow Cooker Amaretto-Poached Peaches~992~201~170~1~26~547~0~The slow cooker doesn't have to be for all-day projects. This simple dessert is easy to assemble right before a dinner party, and the tender, boozy peaches will be ready to serve by the time you're ready for dessert.

5008994~Apple-Onion Roast Turkey with Pan Gravy~232~50~16~2~3~994~0~Even though turkeys are rarely stuffed in the South, cooks usually tuck a few flavorful ingredients—like apple and onion—inside the bird before it goes into the oven. In this recipe, the outside of the turkey is rubbed with bacon drippings so that the skin will be golden, crisp and delicious.
5008995~Chinese Pineapple Chicken~1158~130~43~9~63~5788~78~A mildly sweet and pungent dish. No soy sauce is used in the sauce, so it is lighter in color than other sweet and pungent dishes.

5009009~Seitan and Polenta Skillet with Fresh Greens~1042~85~28~96~33~3066~10~"Caravan of Dreams is one of the restaurants where my family likes to eat when we're in New York City. It's a funky, comfortable place in the East Village, with food that's hearty and innovative (and all vegan). Once, my younger son ordered the Green Garden Platter, described as ""seasonal mixed greens sautéed with grilled marinated seitan, garlic, and olive oil, topped with grilled carrot polenta in mushroom gravy."" I was intrigued by the combination of seitan and polenta, so when I got home, I made my own version, which bears little resemblance to the restaurant's. There's something enticing about seitan/polenta synergy, and with the addition of greens, the result is a great-looking, hearty dish."

5009013~Tuna and Potato Kebabs with Basque Tomato Sauce~4679~372~30~304~203~8444~651~Tuna, which is hearty enough to stand up to strong Spanish flavors, is particularly popular on the Iberian Peninsula. Dusted with paprika and served atop a sauce of tomatoes with bell peppers and ham, the kebabs make outstanding summertime eating. Pour a Spanish Rioja throughout, and present a caramel flan with berries to finish.
5014102~Nuoc Cham Dipping Sauce~238~50~14~3~0~6449~0~Pleasantly pungent with a touch of heat, this classic spring roll sauce also works well with the chicken satés.
5009015~Butternut Squash, Kale, and Crunchy Pepitas Taco~1437~227~25~41~52~10231~0~Drummed up by our intrepid recipe tester Lauren Godfrey, this nontraditional taco, sweet with squash, earthy and nutty with kale, and crunchy with fried pumpkin seeds (pepitas), is—shhhhh—vegan. Don't tell anyone, but because it is so tasty, no one will care. The cashew crema can be replaced by store-bought crema or our Cumin-lime crema, but after polling both vegetarian and carnivorous friends, everyone preferred the nutty and rich nondairy cashew version (which must be made with raw cashews to work). To prepare the butternut squash, use a sharp peeler to remove the tough skin before slicing it in half and scooping out the seeds and fibers. Lazy cook's tip: Some markets sell butternut squash already peeled and seeded and ready to go.
5009016~Orange Cardamom Cookies~2348~438~186~118~92~2220~257~Want to shake up your cookie platter? Simply make a notch in two of these lightly spiced sugar cookies, then interlock them to create an edible sculpture that also makes a beautiful tree ornament.
5009017~Almond Aioli~1198~19~3~26~119~1330~0~Blanched almonds go into a blender with water and oil and come out as a luscious aioli. Because the nuts aren't toasted, the sauce doesn't actually taste very nutty. It's more decadent than yogurt, more subtle than mayo.

5009022~Clams Casino With Bacon and Bell Pepper~1701~124~13~61~106~3013~129~A vinegary red bell pepper mixture cuts through the richness of the bacon for a bite that's salty, smoky, and sweet.
5009023~Chicken and Dumplings with Mushrooms~2286~216~21~144~122~15752~632~Our favorite Dutch oven is heavy-duty, big enough for any stew, and handsome enough to put on the table.
5009024~"Oysters Rockefeller ""Deconstructed"""~7902~231~50~125~706~16187~1887~This recipe was created by chefs Slade Rushing and Allison Vines-Rushing of the Longbranch in Abita Springs, Louisiana. It's part of a special menu they created for Epicurious's Wine.Dine.Donate program.

5009029~Udon Noodle Salad~1825~113~41~56~66~4338~28~Forget deep-fried noodles: Miso dressing gives this hearty vegetable meal flavor minus the saturated fat.

5009033~Spoon Bread with Sour Cream and Cheese~3149~337~103~94~155~12508~645~Highly recommended!
5012698~Spiced Cider Cup~935~214~206~0~0~94~0~Highly recommended!
5009035~Vietnamese Sticky Chicken with Daikon and Carrot Pickle~925~149~111~23~25~4827~49~The chicken and pickled vegetables are meant to be wrapped up in lettuce leaves and eaten with your hands.
5009036~Roasted Garlic-Balsamic Steak Sauce~1141~282~180~4~0~3031~0~A sweet substitute for traditional steak sauce. Try it on a rib eye, use it to marinate flank steak, or mix it into ground beef for burgers.
5009037~Potato Cheddar Rolls~7860~1339~155~234~160~22039~298~Highly recommended!
5009038~Green Bean and Tomato Salad with Buttermilk Dressing~1858~246~120~53~46~1919~0~David Chang's buttermilk dressing is our kind of ranch. Use the freshest beans possible: You want that tender snap.
5009039~Plain Genoise~1522~321~177~35~10~335~374~This rich, delicate cake forms the basis for many filled, frosted, and glazed cakes. A good plain gênoise is hard to beat—it has an elegance that derives from its simplicity, and I even like them unadorned. Many recipes for gênoise add butter as an enrichment. Unfortunately, sometimes the extra manipulation the incorporation of the butter necessitates causes these light batters to fall. So I prefer to add a few extra egg yolks instead—they not only help enrich the cake, they also provide greater stability to the foam, ultimately making the batter easier to prepare.
5009040~Moroccan Lamb and Eggplant Matzo Pie with Spicy Tomato Sauce~4787~388~196~187~283~18245~551~Highly recommended!
5009041~Gratineed Gnocchi with Spinach and Ricotta~501~51~0~19~25~1738~0~Bubbling cheeses and tender spinach elevate store-bought gnocchi (look for it in the dried-pasta section).
5009043~Minted Mai Tai~2847~603~487~13~62~60~0~The mai tai was invented in 1944 at the original Trader Vic's restaurant in Oakland, California. There are many variations of the drink, including this mint-accented version. Look for almond syrup in the coffee-and-tea section of the supermarket.
5009044~Peanut Butter Pie~2818~314~295~36~158~881~266~Highly recommended!

5009047~Lamb Moussaka with Currants~5661~773~405~221~204~23518~583~This eggplant and lamb casserole, a taverna staple, is known the world over as the Greek national dish. In this lightened version, it's topped with yogurt rather than the customary béchamel sauce. (Moussaka is often made with beef instead of lamb.)
5009048~Dinner Rolls Six Ways~871~269~23~112~3~3995~14~One simple master recipe, based on a classic French pain de mie, proves endlessly changeable—feel free to think of the five suggestions that accompany it here as merely a start, and let your imagination take it from there.
5009049~Steamed Scrod Fillets Chinese Style~834~20~9~39~76~27431~83~Highly recommended!

5009056~Rustic Pear Tart with Late-Harvest Riesling~1635~343~64~45~0~1164~4~The rich, fruity sweetness of a late-harvest Riesling (added to a syrup that is drizzled over the free-form tart) beautifully complements the natural sugars in roasted pears.
5009057~Chilled Cream of Zucchini Soup with Mussels and Fresh Mint~5627~464~244~198~278~9231~1086~(Crème Froide de Courgettes et Moules à la Menthe Fraîche)

5009066~Tagine Bil Kok~1052~189~108~6~27~965~0~The Centre de Formation en Restauration Traditionnelle, a government-sponsored cooking school in Rabat, is dedicated to preserving the art of traditional Moroccan gastronomy. The students, all young women, will go on to staff Morocco's embassies and consulates around the world. This classic tagine recipe, given to me by the Centre's former director, Monsieur Tamer, is part of the school's delectable curriculum.
5009067~Baked Camembert with Thyme & Garlic~732~106~15~10~27~661~0~This recipe is a favorite of mine on a cold winter's night as it always reminds me of times with friends when we would ski and snowboard all day then sit by a log fire and eat and drink all night. If you don't have maple syrup on hand, use a spoonful of honey instead.
5009068~Dark Moon~708~53~49~7~54~1256~178~Sorenson uses locally made House Spirits coffee liqueur, made with Stumptown beans, in this cold-brew cocktail. It's delicious, but hard to find outside of Oregon. In its place, use any other coffee liqueur.
5009069~Crab Cakes with Creamy Caper Sauce~4339~104~6~184~355~8398~1048~"""Last summer I attended an event at the Three Clock Inn in South Londonderry, Vermont. The chef prepared a lovely luncheon, and it included delicious crab cakes,"" Bill Brett of Bondville, Vermont. ""When I went home, I came up with my own version."""
5009071~Cheeseburgers with Charred Green Chiles and Onions~2926~78~40~248~184~7162~935~Ground turkey would make a fine substitute for beef in these Southwest-style burgers (grill until cooked through).
5009072~Lamb and White Bean Stew with Spinach, Parsley, and Dill~4524~796~53~159~77~3275~92~This unusual Iranian stew is served hot at the table from the casserole in which it has been cooked. The lid is lifted, and the delicious aromas of rich tender lamb, fresh herbs, spinach and beans fill the room. Serve with rice or orzo.
5009073~Capucine~1230~118~118~0~78~0~314~A coffee drink served at Jause, the Viennese take on afternoon tea.

5009078~Pork Chops with Spicy Citrus Marinade~216~53~47~1~0~44~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5015190~Sweet and Sour Pork~5498~164~65~105~479~8326~633~Sweet and sour are two of the five flavors of classical Chinese cooking (along with salty, pungent, and bitter), and go lo yuk, as the dish is called, is a favorite way to prepare pork in Cantonese cooking. The recipe here has a lighter sauce more akin to the Cantonese version than the overly sweet goopiness of bad takeout versions, but it also has the crispy boneless pork that any lover of this dish will recognize. I prefer fresh pineapple, but if you like your dish sweeter, use canned pineapple and reserve some of the juice from the can to add to the sauce in place of fresh pineapple juice.
5009080~Sesame-and-Soy Watermelon Poké~1482~171~152~16~77~3898~10~Marinating and searing the watermelon concentrates its flavor and primes it for this savory treatment.
5009081~Coconut Rice~2233~407~22~34~46~1975~0~If you can only find regular coconut milk, buy 2 cans and use the thick cream that's floating at the top. The coconut cream will caramelize during cooking, leaving sweet brown flecks in the rice.
5009082~Bacon Jalapeño Popcorn~2702~176~3~100~180~7216~282~I love the old-school sound of corn popping on the stovetop. I remember the very first time Ryder heard it—we were up at the cabin and he walked in to investigate what the heck was making all the noise. His eyes got as big as saucers when I showed him what was going on in the pot. There’s nothing like seeing stuff you usually take for granted through the fresh eyes of kids. Most kids today only know pre-popped or microwave popcorn. For more flavor and the much-deserved anticipation, there is nothing like the stovetop method. For best results use a heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid and a good handle.
5009083~Spring Vegetables with Shallots and Lemon~1959~297~48~93~43~5431~31~Highly recommended!
5009085~Minestrone~2403~466~175~60~24~15569~44~Highly recommended!
5009086~Pasta Primavera with Smoky Ham~1104~34~7~46~74~4888~253~Accompany this dish with a salad of baby lettuces and sliced sweet onion- such as Vidalia or Maui- and some seeded breadsticks. End with chocolate frozen yogurt drizzled with coffee liqueur or chocolate sauce.
5009087~Mussels with Tomatoes, Jalapeño and Tequila~1553~56~13~84~105~2495~519~"""While in Sarnia, Ontario, on business, I stayed at the Village Inn and had dinner at its restaurant, Monet's Table,"" says Melanie Cooke of Calgary, Alberta. ""I thought I was being adventurous when I ordered the mussel appetizer my first night there. Obviously I'd lost my sense of adventure when I went back the second night and ordered it again."""

5014614~Caramel-Orange Sauce~2585~496~497~2~68~39~240~Highly recommended!
5009091~Smoky Shrimp and Halibut Stew~1792~0~0~246~60~5432~1117~This is fantastic with coleslaw and warm biscuits. What to drink: A not-too-oaky domestic Chardonnay or a white Burgundy, such as one from France's St.-Véran region.
5009092~Strawberry Pazzo Cake with Herbed Crème Fraîche~4797~562~296~119~234~2789~799~"Twelve years ago, I made a simple bowl of ""strawberries pazzo""—pazzo means ""crazy"" in Italian — for my friend Ann Spivack (this book's co-writer). The combination of strawberries, balsamic vinegar, and black pepper has been part of my repertoire for decades. Ann thanked me by baking me this pazzo cake."
5009093~Lemon-Honey Tart with Salted Shortbread Crust~3239~501~269~107~153~3360~753~As a rule, every dough you make should contain salt—it complements the sweetness in your filling—and this buttery shortbread is no exception. Using salt in the crust and the filling helps create balance among the sweet, the bitter (from the lemon peel), and the acidic notes (from the fresh lemon juice).
5009094~Breakfast Hobo Packs with Hash Brown Potatoes, Sausage, and Scallions~2338~71~23~96~188~8335~644~These make-ahead packs are perfect for camping trips as well as quick and easy breakfasts on the go. Shredded potatoes and flavorful sausage are topped with baked eggs and spinach for a hearty morning meal.
5009095~Lemon and Blueberry Ice Cream Terrine~4692~384~338~55~329~1186~1143~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are from < by Lauren Chattman.
5009096~Baileys Pudding Parfaits with Oatmeal-Walnut Crunch~6631~808~489~88~335~1040~708~The oatmeal and nut mixture in this dessert is usually baked on fruit; here, it is cooked on its own, then layered with currants and a pudding made with Baileys Original Irish Cream.
5009097~Twice-Baked Potatoes with Basil and Sour Cream~1184~94~29~13~79~2497~172~Highly recommended!
5009099~Chocolate Chip-Peanut Butter Cookies~2762~414~97~56~135~1995~280~Natural no-stir peanut butter is a special boon for those who like to bake with peanut butter. It's made without trans fats, yet stays smooth and doesn't separate, as most natural peanut butters do.
5009100~Prune, Cherry, and Apricot Frangipane Tart~2475~282~211~41~137~1152~584~When steeped overnight in a grappa syrup, dried fruits plump up with juices that infuse a moist, cakey almond filling in a golden crust.
5009101~Pork Chops Scarpariello~1015~47~8~21~70~2269~132~A perfect introduction to the allure of chiles, this Italian classic balances the cherry peppers' piquancy with roasted bell peppers, lemon, and parsley. It's a bright, summery dish that you'll hanker for all year long.
5009103~Tomato, Caper, Olive and Blue Cheese Salad~795~13~11~20~74~942~60~Highly recommended!
5009104~Zucchini and Spinach Frittata~698~39~22~19~51~497~414~"This frittata is a marriage of ideas gleaned from two similar dishes tasted in the Piedmont: a delicious zucchini and herb ""frittela"" at the restaurant Guido in Costiglioli d'Asti and a spinach ""frittatini"" (both were miniature frittate) at the humble but superb Osteria dell'Unione in Treiso."
5009105~Apple-Cranberry Crumb Pie~2908~497~315~23~92~0~253~Highly recommended!

5009107~Red Cabbage with Apricots and Balsamic Vinegar~1445~203~105~5~69~717~189~Here's a sweet-tart addition to your menu.
5018166~Garlic, White Cheddar and Chipotle Mashed Potatoes~10884~1740~343~281~281~53767~711~Thirty-six garlic cloves may sound like a lot, but they're cooked until mellow in flavor.
5009109~Citrus Sponge Cake with Strawberries~2965~609~408~23~50~1511~370~Highly recommended!
5009110~Salt-Roasted Chicken~405~6~3~0~41~5162~31~Highly recommended!
5009111~White Chocolate Cupcakes with Candied Kumquats~6893~838~481~77~357~3408~809~Coconut milk enhances the taste of the white chocolate; kumquats add tang.
5009112~Roasted Whole Fish and Fennel with Crushed Potatoes, Perserved Lemon, and Charmoula~3799~526~118~60~155~16332~30~Charmoula is a tangy, spicy sauce—in this case, made with cumin, cilantro, garlic, and lemon—that's traditionally served with meat in Morocco.

5015575~Wild Mushroom Lasagne~4605~333~166~189~291~17179~816~Highly recommended!
5009115~Lime, Ginger, and Lemongrass Sorbet~1911~507~490~3~0~15~0~At Selamat Pagi, our Balinese restaurant, lime, ginger, and lemongrass are mainstay ingredients, appearing in many dishes. We were thinking about making a sorbet that reflected some of these ingredients and wondered what would happen if we threw all of them together. Our initial taste transported us back to the lush green hills of Bali, after which we were all too disappointed to find ourselves standing in our test kitchen. Along with lemon sorbet, this might be our go-to refreshment when we desperately need to cool off.
5013718~Spritz Cookies~3236~259~228~25~248~39969~553~Also called pressed butter cookies, spritz are the perfect holiday cookie. They are simple to make with a cookie press, pretty to look at, and delicious to eat. This recipe makes about eight dozen. Yes, you read that right—eight dozen. And the cookies are quick to prepare and ideal for giving as gifts or bringing to cookie parties. You can serve the baked cookies plain or decorate them any number of ways. I like to slather melted chocolate between two cookies for an elegant sandwich cookie. It's also fun to drizzle melted chocolate over the tops. You can also sprinkle the cookies with colored sugar or decorate them with royal icing.
5009117~Grilled Pineapple with Brown Sugar, Coconut, and Rum~697~160~154~1~10~297~0~If your grill is already fired up, why not give it a quick brushing and throw dessert on there, too? A balanced tropical marinade brings depth to caramelized pineapple.
5009119~Pork Tenderloin With Turmeric, Squash, and Collard Greens Salad~1476~75~48~34~114~5711~67~One butternut squash gets used in two ways—raw and roasted—in this fall weeknight dinner, while fish sauce, lime, and coconut add a touch of Southeast Asian flair.
5009120~Frontera Grill's Chocolate Pecan Pie with Coffee Whipped Cream~6183~654~414~107~412~2009~1186~Pastry chef Jennifer Jones of Topolobampo in Chicago shared this recipe as part of a Cinco de Mayo feature on Mexican desserts. Coffee liqueur adds incredible depth to Frontera Grill's legendary chocolate pecan pie, but if you prefer to skip the booze in the whipped cream, use an equivalent amount of pure vanilla extract or espresso instead. Jones prefers to serve this pie when it's warm and gooey, but warns that it's a little tricky to cut that way. Her solution is to cool the pie completely, cut it into slices, and then pop it back in the oven until it's just heated through.
5009121~Lemon Lemon Loaf~9623~1453~1005~124~415~4109~1382~Sometimes simplicity speaks volumes. Our lemon loaf recipe is very straightforward. We do not add poppy seeds, pecans, or any other extraneous ingredient. We really feel that the most important aspect of a lemon loaf is the zingy lemon flavor, and we accentuate it by using a combination of freshly squeezed lemon juice, freshly grated lemon zest, and a mildly sweet lemon syrup. The sour cream gives this loaf a subtle tang and a dense, moist crumb that cannot be achieved with yogurt. If you want to increase the lemony goodness of these cakes, add the simple glaze after the syrup has set and the cakes are cool. This loaf freezes extremely well, so you can double the recipe and make a few extra loaves.
5009122~Pineapple, Honeydew, and Mango with Ginger and Fresh Herbs~1421~339~260~6~8~2202~0~Basil, cilantro, and red bell pepper bring a savory element to this fruit salad. This is a great dessert, but would be equally good for breakfast or brunch.
5009123~Quick Sausage Pizzas~1559~47~23~80~124~3105~275~Highly recommended!
5009124~Strawberry Shortcake with Grand Marnier Strawberry Compote and Chantilly Cream~5852~939~319~162~229~4633~685~Chef-owner Michael Mina of Michael Mina restaurant in San Francisco created this recipe for Epicurious's Wine.Dine.Donate program.

5009126~Balsamic Fig Chutney with Roasted Grapes~2519~530~401~22~38~3183~0~SERVING SUGGESTIONS: With roast chicken or pork, or spoon atop goat-cheese crostini.
5009127~Orecchiette with Lentils, Onions, and Spinach~3125~591~63~132~21~790~37~Highly recommended!
5009128~Chicken and Fall Vegetable Pot Pie~3829~186~44~378~150~14733~1172~Prepare this in a big, colorful casserole that can go straight from the oven to the table. Sautéed or boiled green beans would be nice alongside; uncork a bottle of Chardonnay to pour with dinner.
5009129~Beer-Braised Beef and Onions~930~122~81~34~34~80~66~Long, slow cooking turns a supermarket chuck roast into something gloriously tender, flavorful, and aromatic. Leftovers are delicious shredded, heated in the sauce, and served over egg noodles.
5009130~Fig and Onion Bruschetta~2251~187~110~102~115~4926~352~Highly recommended!

5009133~Weekday Vegetable Soup~587~42~27~7~46~5993~0~Highly recommended!
5009134~Chilled Cucumber and Orange Juice with Oregano~250~57~51~3~0~0~0~"Moroccans love fresh juices, and the combinations they make are eclectic and highly seasonal. This is one of my favorites. Although it is commonly prepared as a juice, it can also be a drinkable dessert, especially on warm summer days. I once had it as a ""salad"" served with a spoon in late fall in the eastern High Atlas. Oranges hadn't yet ripened, and instead the cook used small clementines from down the valley. Served before a communal platter of Berber Barley Couscous with Vegetables, the drink seemed closer to a light, sophisticated, vibrant green gazpacho than a rustic salad."
5009135~Sauteed Cod with Creamed Corn and Summer Succotash~478~61~26~18~29~587~58~Here's a good example of Thomas Keller's culinary magic: Simple flavors come together spectacularly in this special dish from The French Laundry in Napa Valley.

5010598~White Chocolate Frosting~9774~604~470~67~825~2016~1719~This recipe was created to accompany Chocolate Strawberry Orance Wedding Cake .
5013979~Salmon Glazed with Honey and Mustard~1341~81~45~0~110~2847~0~"""I made this recipe in a cooking class I taught here in Vancouver, and the crowd was so pleased they gave me a standing ovation,"" says Sylvia Molnar of Vancouver, British Columbia. ""It's a gorgeous dish that's even better served with lemon-scented rice or potatoes."""
5009140~Corn and Herb-Bread Sausage Stuffing~5011~962~120~128~60~24474~0~If this stuffing is to be baked inside the holiday turkey, reduce the amount of chicken broth to 2 1/4 cups.
5009141~Spiced Yam Pudding~1021~130~114~15~44~1747~492~Canned yams make this side dish a snap.
5009142~Chowders~4497~809~172~92~85~21704~89~Traditional chowders all start off with a hearty soup base of onions and potatoes, and that makes a good soup just by itself. To this fragrant base you then add chunks of fish, or clams, or corn, or whatever else seems appropriate. (Note: You may leave out the pork and substitute another tablespoon of butter for sautéing the onions.)

5009146~The Rattlesnake~552~133~131~9~0~201~4~The double-shake method is key to this cocktail’s texture. The first round is to break up the egg white; the second is to chill and froth the drink.
5009147~Korean-Style Short Ribs~1132~147~77~561~338~9217~1944~A long marinade in a mixture of Korean ingredients infuses these short ribs with spicy-sweet heat. Braising the ribs locks in the fiery, garlicky flavor and results in incredibly tender meat that pulls easily away from the bone.
5009148~Salsa Verde With Toasted Breadcrumbs~2474~90~0~28~226~1553~60~Other tender herbs such as cilantro, dill, and/or tarragon can be used instead for this salsa verde recipe. Though the breadcrumbs don’t stay crisp, they give body and subtle crunch to the sauce.

5009150~Lamb Stew with Spinach and Garbanzo Beans~2540~224~177~126~136~6436~459~"""When my ancestors left Spain and settled on the Greek island of Rhodes five hundred years ago,"" writes Rebecca Levy of Los Angeles, California, ""they brought with them their Sephardic culture. Likewise, when I fled Greece during World War II and eventually relocated to Los Angeles, I brought with me the traditions of my home. Many of my recipes are centuries old, and since each one is connected to a story, I always try to tell a little anecdote about the food so that the history will not be lost."""

5009162~White Russian~295~87~1~0~7~104~20~Highly recommended!
5009163~Brined Pork Loin with Onion, Raisin, and Garlic Compote~765~124~118~22~21~46577~62~Brining results in moist, tender meat. Be sure to use a large center-cut loin, which cooks more evenly than two smaller pieces tied together. Begin this recipe one day ahead. What to drink: A medium-bodied fruity red, such as Merlot, or a fruity white, such as Australian Sémillon.
5009164~Mom's Sweet-and-Sour Red Cabbage~835~82~66~1~55~1781~0~My mother grew up in Bad Nauheim, Germany, where she helped her parents with their inn and restaurant called Die Krone (The Crown). When I was growing up, she cooked several traditional German dishes, but one of the most memorable for me was her recipe for sweet-and-sour red cabbage. Though I was a pretty picky eater, I adored the cabbage and loved how it colored the mashed potatoes my mother would always serve with it. Mom never wrote the recipe down for me, but I reached out to German relatives and re-created it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed taking the trip down memory lane. Grating the cabbage takes a while, so make sure to have some good tunes on!

5009174~Apple Walnut Pancakes with Cinnamon Cream and Fudge Sauce '21' Club~2413~215~160~22~164~129~260~These thin pancakes resemble crêpes more than the thick apple pancakes served at '21' back in the thirties and forties. They are definitely more delicate than the traditional version, but the flavors of apples and walnuts still hark back to their heftier ancestors. Most of the components of this recipe may be made ahead of time and the dessert assembled just prior to serving.
5009175~Brown Butter, Ginger, and Sour Cream Coffee Cake~6312~1154~693~218~198~7698~384~Make this crumbly cake a day ahead; the early risers will thank you.
5009176~Grilled Oregano Chicken~2129~113~39~12~189~5505~47~The key to grilling large pieces of chicken is patience. Starting with the skin side up reduces flare-ups, and medium heat gives you browned (not blackened) skin and juicy flesh.

5009185~Mussels in Light Broth~1581~62~14~128~77~5808~426~Rasam, as prepared in most homes in Southern India, uses either tamarind or tomatoes as the base. It is a piquant broth poured over steaming hot rice. In our home—both in Kerala and America—rasam was a staple part of everyday meals. One night when I was a teenager, I was out to dinner with my brother Tom in New York City’s Little Italy and ate mussels cooked in a light tomato broth very reminiscent of rasam. I couldn’t wait to get home, buy fresh mussels, and cook them in rasam. This dish has made its rounds in my kitchens for close to three decades now. Make sure to have some fresh crusty bread to soak up the tomato-mussel broth.

5009223~Zucchini Salad With Ajo Blanco Dressing & Spiced Nuts~4032~186~8~54~342~1079~0~"Over the last few years I have started to love zucchini, but I have to admit that by the end of the season, it's like, ""Not another bloody zucchini!"" That said, this is one of the joys of eating seasonally—anticipation and excitement at the start of the season, despair and overload at the end."
5009224~Homemade Irish Corned Beef and Vegetables~1525~345~267~10~1~514123~0~Spicy horseradish cream and malty Guinness mustard amp up the flavor of this home-corned beef. You might need to special-order the brisket from your butcher, and you'll have to start brining the meat eight days before you cook and serve it. The Insta Cure No. 1 is optional, but it's nice to use because it gives the meat its traditional pink color. Save the leftover corned beef and vegetables for the sandwiches and hash.

5009227~Macadamia and Ginger Stuffing~7390~855~66~221~346~12653~818~The sweet bread called for here was introduced to Hawaii by nineteenth-century Portuguese immigrants. The stuffing can also be cooked inside the turkey, provided the bird is roasted immediately after being stuffed. For more flavor, rub the turkey with a mixture of salt and pepper and two tablespoons each of sesame oil, orange juice and lime juice, and let it marinate overnight.
5009228~Haroseth (Dried Fruit and Nut Paste)~3161~272~197~71~211~930~0~Haroseth, a symbolic seder food, alludes to the mortar that the Jews used to build the pyramids when enslaved by the Egyptian pharaoh. Though haroseth visually mimes the unappealing look of cement, its taste is actually a delicious combination of fresh or dried fruit, nuts, spices and wine. There are as many variations of haroseth as there are seder tables around the world, and all reflect a myriad of traditions. This recipe is inspired by my grandmother's simple grated apple, walnut, and cinnamon version, along with the flavors of my husband's Middle Eastern background.
5009229~Crispy Spiced Potato Wedges~5329~808~187~155~35~20175~0~Mustard seeds give these steak house-style wedges great flavor and crunch.
5009231~BLT Burgers~2531~50~8~215~161~4240~710~With the exception of beef and cheese, there is no burger combination more revered than beef and bacon. Here, we've improved on a classic by putting crumbled pieces of cooked bacon in the middle of the burger. It adds unexpected bits of crisp texture and diffuses smoky flavor throughout the beef.
5009232~Tomato-Sausage Sauce~3254~156~25~247~188~5920~0~An all-purpose red sauce that's ideal for pasta and meatballs, lasagna, cannelloni, etc.

5014037~Wine-Braised Brisket with Tart Cherries~3719~444~312~129~145~8240~421~"Beef brisket is the centerpiece of many Jewish holiday meals, particularly at Passover, and every family has their favorite way of preparing it. There are countless recipes out there, but how many do you need besides your grandmother's? At least one more: This one!
Why? Because the meat is slowly braised in Pinot Noir, and the cherry notes in the wine pair brilliantly with dried tart cherries, which plump up with winey beef juices to become little mini-pouches of flavor on their own. Add to that a bit of star anise, which perfumes the brisket and your home with an exotic and enticing hint of licorice. Season the mixture with the sweet-and-sour agrodolce dance of brown sugar and balsamic vinegar, and you have a brisket that is at once counterintuitively familiar and wonderfully different. Like all braised meats, brisket improves in flavor, and slices more easily, if made a day ahead and chilled (see Cooks' Notes)."
5009236~Feta Burgers with Grilled Red Onions~2546~324~118~126~86~9807~262~These newfangled burgers are stuffed with feta cheese. Pressing the center of the raw hamburger to form a slight indentation prevents the burger from puffing up in the center when cooking.

5009260~Baked Crab Dip~1454~140~17~30~102~2326~176~Fresh crab meat is so rich, fabulous, and sweet that, for this dip, I wanted to highlight the texture and flavor of the crab without masking it. Served bubbly hot with a crisply browned, lemon zestpanko topping, this dip will be a party favorite—easy to put together, quick to bake, and quick to disappear, too.
5016816~Skordalia~391~72~15~8~0~156~9~Skordalia is often made with mashed potatoes or bread soaked in water, but we feel the yogurt gives it more flavor. Skordalia is also good with grilled fish or chicken breasts.

5013995~Tahini Sauce~1580~56~13~59~126~23~0~Sesame seed sauce is a popular condiment throughout the Middle East. It's especially prized in Israel, because Jewish dietary laws prohibit mixing meat and dairy products. Thus, the yogurt and cucumber or yogurt and mint sauce served with grilled lamb in Turkey and Lebanon would not be consumed by observant Jewish barbecue buffs in Israel. But tahini has the creaminess and tangy taste associated with yogurt.

5009280~Ancho Chile–Rubbed Grilled Corn~482~70~57~2~24~394~63~Grilled corn is one of the easiest way to do summer right. Some recipes will have you soak the corn in salt water before grilling, but for husked corn, this actually works against plumpness. This recipe can be kerneled and served on top of a burger or eaten straight off the cob, dressed in cilantro and crumbled cotija cheese.

5012864~Mushroom, Rajas, and Corn Taco with Queso Fresco~1946~288~9~48~62~1208~87~The earliest Mexican cuisine was vegetable-based, so in times past, before Spanish beef, chicken, and pork worked their way into every taco, there were no doubt plenty of satisfying vegetable taco recipes. Today most vegetables are consumed as salsas, in soups, or stuffed into quesadillas and empanadas, but there's no reason why a vegetable taco shouldn't be every bit as tasty and unusual as any other. This sumptuous vegetarian feast is based on the classic combination of roasted poblano chiles and mushrooms, with the addition of corn and mild-flavored, soft queso fresco. This taco is often favored by even the most committed carnivores. In other seasons, bits of diced cooked sweet potato, zucchini, chayote, squash blossoms, or golden winter squash would be welcome additions.
5009288~Curried Herring~22~5~5~0~0~390~0~Herring is an essential part of Scandinavian cuisine and always has a place in the breakfast smorgasbord, along with other kinds of salted and pickled fish, breads, pastries, cheeses, cereals, eggs, and potatoes.

5009291~Escarole Salad with Apples, Candied Walnuts, and Saint André Cheese~1244~61~27~23~105~122~0~Skip the wine—this salad is perfect with a Belgian ale. Saint Andréis a soft, ripened cheese much like Brie or Camembert. Either cheese would make a good substitute.
5009293~Raspberry Hazelnut Triangles~670~47~3~15~47~0~0~These cookies are like bite-size Linzertortes. Instead of being cut into triangles as suggested below, the dough can be cut into whatever other shape is preferred.
5009294~Spritz Wreaths~474~52~31~5~23~526~53~Cylindrical cookie presses are a fast and convenient way to make uniform intricate shapes. If you prefer something other than a wreath-shaped cookie, change the disk of your press and decorate as desired with colored sugars, nuts, or dragées to create Christmas trees, snowflakes, or poinsettias. The possibilities are endless.

5009323~Stewed Cannellini Beans With Chiles and Thyme~610~114~11~25~3~2536~0~This bean recipe is purposely brothy; if you have leftovers, reheat and smash them—they're great on toast with an egg.

5009328~Prosecco and Raspberry Jelly~343~88~83~0~0~0~0~Prosecco and jelly: two of my favourite things. And when combined with raspberries, they make a wickedly celebratory concoction. The reason for putting this in the freezer for the first half an hour is to help set the prosecco bubbles in the jelly. It also works very well with cava.

5009340~Mascarpone, Ham, and Asparagus Tart~2616~134~75~88~186~3060~523~IMPROV: Instead of tarragon, try dill; sub bacon for the ham.

5009363~Spicy Sichuan Tofu (Mapo Doufu)~860~35~9~32~60~1234~85~"Commonly made with minced beef or pork, this traditional Sichuan dish (literally, ""pocked-face lady's tofu,"" said to be named for the food vendor who came up with it) is all about the bean sauce, which infuses the bean curd with a deeply nuanced spiciness. We tested the recipe with several commercial brands (be sure to get one that says ""toban jiang""), and though they varied in flavor and texture, they all yielded great results. For sources for the Sichuan peppercorns, hot bean sauce, fermented black beans, and Asian chile powder."
5009364~Vegetable Rundown~1657~302~89~39~31~5293~0~"""Rundown"" (also called ""oiled down"" or ""oil dong"") is a classic stew served throughout the islands, often using saltfish or mackerel.

5009365~Roasted Shrimp and Mushrooms with Ginger and Green Onions~1170~128~4~33~64~411~194~You can also roast asparagus alongside. Toss the trimmed spears with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and place on a separate rimmed baking sheet.

Here’s a twist on the classic that packs more flavor and far more nutrition with the powers of mustard greens and roasted red pepper. These are great for a snack or for lunch at work.
5009373~Chicken Paprikash with Sour Cream~3398~172~49~214~231~17760~859~Slow-cooking dark leg meat results in incredibly tender, flavorful chicken. However, if you prefer white meat you can substitute bone-in chicken breasts. Placing the onions on the bottom of the slow cooker will ensure that they become silky soft as the chicken releases its juices, creating a heady sauce.

5009378~Goat Cheese Ice Cream with Roasted Red Cherries~2104~122~92~37~171~1825~574~Sweet-tart roasted Michigan cherries are balanced by pure, tangy goat cheese. Like a cherry cheesecake, but better.

5009383~Sparkling Tarragon-Gin Lemonade~313~37~32~0~0~0~0~For a zippier, more refreshing cocktail (that's what summer drinks are about, right?), it's all in the wrist. Muddling extracts essential oils to deliver maximum herb impact. Tarragon flavors the boozy lemonade here, but basil makes an excellent sub. And while muddled mint is essential to a Mojito, you won't believe what it can add to a Margarita. Shake up a few and see.
5009384~Grilled Sausage Sandwiches with Caramelized Onions and Gruyère Cheese~1973~154~69~57~123~3109~268~Serve these with a couple of tall, cold beers.
5009385~Mustard Greens with Chipotle and Bacon~1306~66~22~74~94~2743~115~Though they're a nod to the classic pairing of cooking greens with a ham hock, these gently bitter greens have several important differences: Because they are blanched rather than braised, they hold their intense color; bacon crumbled over the top, rather than cooked with the greens, retains its crispness; and smoky chipotle gives the dish an alluring heat.

Imagine a fudgy brownie—chocolatey, rich, ringing every bell—and then picture yourself dancing around your kitchen, exuberant with the knowledge that these babies are truly guilt-free, since (almost) all the sinfully sweet goodness is derived from bananas, applesauce, and cocoa powder. That’s something to get up for in the morning! And I’ll say what I want to say without saying it: Fiber never tasted so good.

5009400~Kentucky Bourbon Burgoo~6459~1168~310~171~111~21231~196~"""If gumbo is the national stew of Cajun country, burgoo is the stew of Kentucky,"" Ronni Lundy asserts in her book Shuck Beans, Stack Cakes, and Honest Fried Chicken. Because the stew is made in many different ways with a variety of ingredients, the ""Burgoo Song"" by Robert Myles claims, ""You can toss in almost anything that ever walked or flew."" Many early recipes for burgoo include squirrel in addition to chicken, beef, and pork. In Kentucky, Anderson County, which hosts its Burgoo Festival every September, is known as the burgoo capital of the world. Arenzville, Illinois, makes a similar claim. But the French lay claim to the basic concept of burgoo, and it's conceivable that the word burgoo arose somehow from the French ragout (pronounced ra-goo), also a term describing a stew."

5009454~Passover Honey Nut Cake in Soaking Syrup~4095~389~316~60~268~658~370~"The Middle Eastern tone is part of this cake's appeal. A very nutty cake is suffused with a honey-citrus soaking syrup, much like baklava in concept but flour-free, making it suitable for Passover. A little goes a long way. For large Seder crowds, you can double the recipe and bake it in a 9-inch springform pan or a 9 by 13-inch rectangular pan. I serve this cake cut into small squares or diamonds placed in small muffin liner cups. Copeland Marks, in his book Sephardic Cooking, attributes this to Turkish cuisine. Joan Nathan calls it ""Tishpishiti"" in her book, Jewish Cooking in America and points to Syrian, as well as Turkish roots as does Claudia Roden in her book, Mediterranean Cookery. A nutty classic indeed! My version is inspired by a recipe simply called ""Nut Cake,"" found in From My Grandmother's Kitchen, by Viviane Alcheck Miner with Linda Krinn. If you are interested in Sephardic recipes along with a very engaging family history, this book is a real find."

You can easily make restaurant-crisp fries at home with the Vedge method: start with baked potatoes, then crisp them up in a little oil.

5015449~Green Onion Sausage and Shrimp Gravy~715~64~8~103~8~1981~882~In South Louisiana, any sauce is called gravy. This dish would be our equivalent of biscuits and sausage gravy, except we've got all this seafood down here that finds its way into nearly everything. Serve this gravy over biscuits ) with Oeufs au Plat , and you've really got something. As a chef, I make this a bit more complicated than it needs to be: I start with the shrimp in the pan, then remove them so they don't overcook, and then I add them back once it's all come together.

Traditionally, many Hanukkah foods celebrate the oil in addition to the light. One of the most common is the jelly doughnut, known as sufganiyah. The word derives from the Hebrew word for ""sponge,"" an apt description for the texture of the doughnuts. I think they are more accurately ""pillowy."""

5009611~Sweet Corn Ice Cream With Butterscotch~3349~267~251~18~260~3256~845~When I was first served corn ice cream, I thought the guy who made it was having a laugh. To me, corn meant succotash, soup, and steamy ears buttered and sprinkled with crunchy sea salt. It did not mean dessert. Yet while it took me a good minute to get my head around the idea, it took me only about half a second to eat every last bit. Of course, corn ice cream makes perfect sense—corn is good mates with dairy; and during summer, the veg is sweeter than strawberries, peaches, and other fruits commonly spotted in ice cream. A healthy drizzle of butterscotch and a scattering of caramel popcorn add sweet–salty complexity and crunch.
5009613~Thai-Style Crab Salad in Papaya~626~79~48~58~10~4610~202~Look for Gold or Strawberry papayas. Their sweet flavor complements this tangy crab salad beautifully.

5012745~Grilled Fresh Sardines with Fennel and Preserved Lemon~731~12~7~10~72~10716~27~At the thought of Morocco, the mind tends to wander to the teeming heart of Marrakech; but the windswept coastal city of Essaouira, with its whitewashed buildings and heaping displays of glimmering fish (which you can have grilled on the spot), offers another sort of paradise. We can't supply Essaouira's particular perfume of sea and smoke, but the simplicity and clean flavors of this lemon-infused dish will take you there in spirit.
5009624~Quick Pecan Tart~4322~396~338~33~320~1287~292~You can replace the pecans with just about any nut — such as pine nuts, almonds or cashews — and get an equally delicious result, or use a variety for a more interesting dessert. Some dough will be left over, so you can bake a few cookies alongside the tart.
5009627~White Bean Chicken Chili~1534~44~5~85~107~2016~561~Highly recommended!

But there's no denying that in the past 20 years two factors have had a huge influence on how we cook: speed and healthfulness. Oven-baked chicken satisfies on both counts, offering a crispy, tasty coating and moist meat with less fat and fewer calories. Plus, it's quick enough to make on a Tuesday night. Add a light, bright arugula salad and youve got dinner.

5019204~Brussels Sprouts with Panko~1953~358~64~105~35~1225~9~Brussels sprouts were not part of the Palestinian kitchen when I was growing up. I discovered them here in the States and very eagerly tried to push them on my children. To that end, I did what any good mother would do—I pumped up their flavor by adding a little tahini sauce and sweet pomegranate molasses. It worked! In fact these Brussels sprouts were so delicious that they made it onto the original Tanoreen menu and I've never taken them off.
5009724~Whole Wheat Oricchiette with Bitter Greens and Radishes~1828~56~8~79~141~2055~225~Radishes and breadcrumbs give this greens-packed vegetarian pasta its crunchy texture.

This is simply a spectacular cake—moist and light with spiced pumpkin flavor and sweet bites of coconut and pineapple. In addition, it is a snap to make. It requires two 9-inch cake pans to make the layers, but the cake itself can be mixed together with a rubber spatula and bowl. If all the cake ingredients are pre-measured and the cake pans prepared, this can be a fun kitchen project to do with children, especially since it can be made ahead and frozen.

The type of cinnamon used in Thailand is from the Cassia tree. Cinnamon has a sweet, woody fragrance in both ground and stick forms.

5009766~Persian Cucumber and Purple Rice Salad~509~18~6~5~46~313~10~Juicy, crunchy cucumbers lighten the starch in a rice salad, and lemony coriander accentuates the citrus in the vinaigrette. So-called Persian cukes seem especially beautiful against a background of exotic purple jasmine rice. This is a party dish for which, no doubt, you will become justly famous.
5009768~Roast Beef Tenderloin with Caesar Crust~651~78~31~12~23~1322~47~Lightly salting a center-cut tenderloin, a.k.a. chateaubriand, overnight allows the salt to penetrate this luxurious roast and keep it extra-flavorful and juicy.

5009770~Perfect Pork Chops~1222~19~11~21~67~4327~132~Pork chops can get pretty dried out. This recipe fixes that age-old problem. It's also a great main course for a family-style dinner. Just slice the pork after it's done cooking, place in a serving dish, and then top with the savory mustard sauce. These pork chops make wonderful leftovers and serve as a nice addition to a breakfast or atop a salad for lunch. Perfect Pork Chops also depend on getting the right pork. Pasture-raised pork will contain a healthier mix of fats and vitamin D. Pork also contains high concentrations of thiamine, which is used by all cells to make energy and is particularly important to the brain, and B6, which helps make several key neurotransmitters.
5009771~Grilled Marinated Sirloin Flap Steaks~394~87~52~4~0~2370~0~We make this super-easy, super-tasty dish all year long. The bold combination of soy sauce, balsamic, and maple syrup works its magic on the meat quickly, so it only needs to marinate for as long as it takes to get your grill fired up. In the fall and winter, we pair this steak with maple-sweetened butternut squash. Come summer, it's a natural with a tomato salad and corn on the cob.
5009772~Chocolate, Orange and Honey Cake~4860~798~640~58~191~2518~506~Two layers of tender orange sponge cake are embellished with a rich orange and honey chocolate glaze. Any leftover chocolate glaze can be chilled, rolled into small rounds and kept refrigerated to serve as truffles with coffee or tea.
5009773~Coconut and Lychee Sorbet~774~170~162~2~12~284~0~I adore lychee juice, which tastes very much like the fresh fruit. You can buy aseptic packages of the juice in Asian markets, and I've seen them in many supermarkets. This sorbet is not only delicious, it's fun.

5009791~Salt-As-You-Go Pasta~949~55~8~17~70~412~44~The combination of salty water and salty Parmesan puts this pasta at risk of becoming oversalted. If that happens, throw in a knob of unsalted butter at the end to mellow it and add a smooth finish.

5009793~Carolina-Style Pork BBQ Sandwiches~1938~450~360~1~0~3531~0~"Arguably, some of the best ‘cue in the country can be found in North Carolina, where two distinct types of slow-cooked
pig prevail. The first is Eastern barbecue, which is distinguished by slow-cooking a whole hog and including
both the white and dark meat in chopped sandwiches and platters. Eastern ‘cue boasts just a hint of vinegar and
red pepper, which is added to the meat mix rather than used as a sauce. Western North Carolina ‘cue (aka Lexington-style)
is made from pork shoulder only. In addition to incorporating plenty of vinegar, sugar, and spices, it also mixes
in a good amount of ketchup to create an actual sauce for the pork. This slow-cooker recipe falls somewhere in between.
If you like, you can skip the sauce altogether and enjoy a basic roasted pork, which is not only fantastic on
a bun with slaw and hot sauce, but is great for making burritos, barbecue pizza, or nachos.
I recommend using a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker for this recipe in order to comfortably fit the pork shoulder. You can
also cut this recipe in half and use a smaller slow cooker."

5009799~Yellow Chicken Adobo~1066~105~49~16~64~2134~62~Though widely accepted as the national dish of the Philippines, no two adobos are the same. This one calls for an unapologetic amount of turmeric, which has a somewhat bitter, definitely earthy flavor, and those deep, dark notes are backed up by charred coconut. This recipe is from Bad Saint, one of Bon Appétit's Hot 10, America's Best New Restaurants 2016.

5009815~Herb-Roasted Turkey with Apple Cider Gravy~4587~728~552~13~179~190709~536~Brining the turkey in the refrigerator for two days ensures an incredibly moist result. We do not recommend stuffing brined turkeys because the brine can make the stuffing too salty. A do-ahead gravy base eliminates last-minute stirring and thickening. Look for fresh bay leaves in the produce section.
5009816~Classic Vinaigrette~147~0~0~0~13~709~0~This vinaigrette is delicious as is, though it can serve as a base as well.

With this mixture, we try to unmask the depth of flavor in our native seafood, not overpower it. We want every bite to display a full flavor profile, so we liberally sprinkle seasoning on the entire piece of fish. That means both sides. Make a decent-sized batch of this mixture so it will always be handy, then rub it or sprinkle it on the food. Remember, mixtures such as this cost very little to make yourself but quite a lot if you buy them at retail."

5009821~Oysters on the Half Shell with Spicy Vinegar~1081~224~160~15~5~2409~5~Oysters were very much a part of American life in Colonial days, and were cooked in every conceivable manner — boiled, scalloped or steamed; turned into pies and fritters; or, in the winter in Savannah, roasted over an open fire. Here they're presented on the half shell, with shallots, green onions and vinegar.
5009822~Peel-and-Eat Spiced Shrimp with Chipotle Remoulade~4496~1645~0~21~30~46752~194~The spices that are added to the shrimp cooking liquid were inspired by Cajun crawfish boils.
5009823~Summer Vegetable Stir-Fry~1364~60~6~9~121~277~11~This recipe is a template, open to endless riffs depending on what vegetables you have on hand. No matter what seasonal produce you use, remember to keep an eye out for a mix of colors.

5009827~Green Papaya Salad with Shrimp~587~45~21~36~29~3075~220~Green papaya salad in all its regional variations - often flavored with pork, beef, or shrimp (as below)-is hugely popular throughout Southeast Asia. The dish is made from unripe Southeast Asian papayas, which have firm white flesh and white seeds. The current popularity of Vietnamese and Thai food in the United States has increased these papayas' availability, although it is still generally limited to Asian markets. Such papayas can grow to the size of cantaloupes or larger and range in shape from oval to round. Look for rock-hard dark green fruit without a trace of pink or yellow blush. If you don't see any, ask (some shopkeepers do not display them).
5009828~Veal Chops in Curry Sauce~509~39~3~0~34~961~102~Pork tenderloin makes a delicious replacement for veal in this dish. Rice and chutney complete the meal.

5019719~Tuscan White Bean Salad with Spinach, Olives, and Sun-Dried Tomatoes~1860~111~11~105~120~4304~122~Foster's variation on a simple Tuscan classic might be considered heresy to purists, but our customers are crazy about the addition of olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and spinach. It's a great dish for summer buffets. The salad can be made a day in advance; serve it lightly chilled or at room temperature.
5009831~Hot Artichoke and Tarragon Dip~1379~19~3~36~134~2607~209~Surround the dip with carrots sticks, cauliflower, fennel, yellow squash and zucchini slices for a colorful presentation.

5009835~Baked Cod with Orange, Caper and Olive Sauce~797~127~120~4~28~987~0~Highly recommended!
5009836~Arugula and Fava-Bean Crostini~1109~231~70~30~0~1627~0~Springtime in Tuscany means eating young green fava beans with salty, nutty crumbles of Pecorino Toscano—a firm sheep's-milk cheese. That favorite snack was a jumping-off point for these savory little toasts. Fresh arugula, both puréed and roughly chopped, punctuates the spread with spice and texture. If you can't get your hands on fresh fava beans, frozen edamame work well, too.
5009837~Crab and Crimini Bisque~1831~109~24~54~121~4677~592~Crab and mushrooms have always made good dining companions, but never more so than in this velvety soup. Serve it as the first course at a dinner party or as the centerpiece of a soup supper, with corn bread on the side.
5009838~Pot-Roasted Artichokes With White Wine and Capers~1675~205~13~52~55~6742~0~One of the reasons I go giddy about springtime is artichokes, particularly the small ones with tips closed tightly, like a flower at night. Some home cooks are reluctant to fill their totes with artichokes, as they'll need to be turned—the barbed leaves plucked off and the other inedible bits trimmed away. I quite like the process. It's meditative and satisfying once you get the hang of it. In this dish, the fleshy artichokes get browned and crispy tops and look like strange, beautiful roses. The acidity in the white wine cuts through the rich, dense veg and, along with the salty pops from the capers, highlights the artichokes' unique herbaceousness.
5009839~Cinnamon-Plum Chutney~4797~1215~742~43~0~5816~0~This sweet-savory condiment is delicious with roasted or grilled meats.
5009840~Seared Calamari with Basil~1586~35~15~69~133~1125~1026~From the delicate calamari to the crunchy celery and crisp greens, this salad is a mélange of wonderful textures. Make sure to use the freshest calamari you can find, and cook it quickly over the hot griddle to keep it as tender as possible.

5009845~Pan con Tomate' y Anchoa—Garlic, Olive Oil, and Fresh Tomato on Toasted Bread~1270~121~53~12~73~2861~47~Nothing could be more simple and down to earth than this tapa, but its appeal is universal. It originated in Catalunya, but can now be found all over Spain. In fact, I will never forget a breakfast of exceptional pan con tomate and steaming café con leche at an outdoor café overlooking the mountains of Granada in Galera, a town of cave dwellings. The recipe that follows has the advantage of last-minute assemblage, so the bread doesn't get soggy. Since ingredients are few, it goes without saying that the very best tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil, and anchovies are essential. If last-minute preparation is not a problem, I suggest the even simpler traditional method of toasting the bread, rubbing it with a cut clove of garlic, then rubbing with a cut tomato, squeezing the tomato gently as you rub. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with salt.

5009848~Papadums With Whipped Dal~1972~214~9~78~94~3516~0~Chips and dip: classic, and every culture has its take. There's hummus and pita, tortilla chips and guac, British chips and tartar sauce... From time to time, we’ll run an Indian take on chips and dip using crunchy papadums (thin and crispy lentil crackers) with a cold, creamy version of dal (stewed beans and lentils). The trick is to keep the dal super light so it doesn’t snap the papadums.

5009889~Boathouse Punch~1378~352~323~6~0~77~0~At the bar, we have giant ice molds to make the ice cubes that keep this punch cold, but when I do it at home, a Tupperware container works just as well. Fill a 1-quart to 2-quart container with hot water (which freezes into clearer ice) and stick it in the freezer twenty-four hours before the party. Then add the giant cube to your punch bowl right before the guests arrive; it keeps everything cold and looks beautiful.

5009893~Lemon Grilled Shrimp Cocktail~789~48~9~21~56~227~194~For an impressive presentation, I always set the lemon halves in red-wine glasses, because their bowls are larger than white-wine glasses. Serve extra lemons alongside.

5009922~Cider-Dijon Pork Chops with Roasted Sweet Potatoes and Apples~2128~325~241~24~83~1374~108~Sautéing is another fast way to make a meal, especially when the pan juices are turned into a sweet and savory sauce, as they are here. This comforting dish features an array of autumn ingredients—apples, fennel, and sweet potatoes—roasted in the oven to caramelize lightly and bring their sugars to the forefront.

5009931~Rich and Flavorful Chicken Stock~475~103~48~4~3~1002~0~There really isn't a lot of work involved in making chicken stockyou pretty much drop everything into a pot of water and let it simmer. What you do need, though, is time and patience to let the chicken, vegetables, and herbs transform the water into a golden, savory liquid that will make all the difference in soups and sauces.
5009932~Fast White-Bean Stew~540~107~3~16~0~2318~0~A colorful and satisfying stew is priceless this time of year, and you can't do much better than a tomatoey broth full of hearty cannellini beans, baby greens, and cubes of baked ham.
5009933~Ice Cream Bombe~2866~456~525~29~62~245~241~This is really a fun dessert. Form this into a mold and serve it with a cookie on the side. If you don't have time to prepare the mango sorbet, Häagen-Dazs makes a good one, and believe me, your friends will have just as much fun. The good news is that you can make this ahead of time. I serve it with fresh raspberries and raspberry sauce.

5009940~Great British Fool~2009~146~99~27~156~1022~581~"At the mention of this British dessert, my mind races through the various references to fools, from the fool that accompanied King Lear on his journey across the howling heath, to the modern question ""What kind of fool are you?"" But the name of this delicate dessert actually comes from the French word fouler, meaning to press or crush, referring to the crushed fruits that are gently folded into thick cream. It is this simplicity that makes the dish shine. And as the British fool, I get to choose the berries and sing ""here we go round the mulberry bush"" as I dish up!"

5009950~Turkey Meat Loaf with Sun-Dried Tomatoes~1069~73~29~81~44~9430~615~A crowd-pleasing standard gets a makeover with ground turkey instead of beef; sautéed vegetables and sun-dried tomatoes add flavor.

5009951~Banana Bread~3422~542~288~135~150~2142~370~Who doesn’t love banana bread? This one is just sweet enough, with fabulous crunch if you add walnuts and coconut, as I always do. There’s no better solution for over-the-hill bananas, and the batter comes together in less than 10 minutes. I’ve been making this recipe — created by my late dear friend Sherry — for almost fifty years; it’s incredibly reliable.
5009952~Wild Mushroom and Gruyère Tart with Fresh Herb Salad~1827~83~11~63~137~3609~286~The base of the tart is purchased puff pastry, which makes this dish — served as an appetizer at Lucques — as easy as it is delicious. With the addition of a soup, it could also be a lovely lunch or supper.

5009963~Herbed Summer Succotash~1705~132~17~40~103~139366~130~In this recipe we used fresh baby lima beans (the frozen ones are excellent, too), but you can substitute any other fresh young shell beans such as fava or cranberry beans.

5017747~Blueberries in Gin Syrup~1743~311~269~6~62~842~0~An aromatic syrup that calls to mind the clean smell of the forest enhances the flavor of fresh blueberries.

5009973~Tofu Aloo Gobi (Cauliflower and Potato Curry)~1088~135~24~32~37~2301~0~We've rarely gone out for Indian food without including aloo gobi among our selections.

5020074~Perfect Rice~1864~391~8~37~16~4364~31~Fluffy texture (thanks to less-starchy converted rice) and the right balance of flavors (bay, thyme, and white pepper) earn this foolproof rice its name.
5009990~Rum-Raisin Pound Cake~5384~672~265~144~308~1964~1015~Highly recommended!
5009991~Three Peas with Barley, Chile & Green Garlic~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~Pea shoots are the young, tender tips and vines of the snow pea or the sugar snap pea plant. Once your plants are established and producing an abundance of pods, clip off leaf and tendril sections about 4 inches (10 cm) long. If you don't have your own plants, look for these tender shoots at farmers' markets or Asian grocery stores. Sambal oelek (or ulek) is an Indonesian chile paste, and tart, citrusy kaffir lime leaves are used in Southeast Asian cooking. Look for both products in Asian markets.
5009992~Diner-Style French Toast~1049~41~39~21~84~1404~531~Diner cooks know three things about French toast: 1. Thick-cut challah is crucial. 2. Cinnamon and vanilla shouldn't be skimped on. 3. Syrup is welcome—but if you do it right, a dusting of powdered sugar is all you really need.

5009996~Swordfish and Caponata Sandwiches~564~10~6~2~57~829~0~Start with tomato soup garnished with chopped fresh basil. Have deli potato salad with the main course, and for dessert, pears with Gorgonzola and biscotti.
5009997~Beet and Asian Pear Salad with Baby Greens~150~31~20~2~0~402~0~Adding moisture and flavor without fat is achieved in the beet and Asian pear salad: Its oil-free dressing is made with mustard, lemon juice, and apple jelly (substituting apricot preserves for the jelly works well in other salads, especially those using bitter greens).
5009998~Sticky Sesame Chicken Wings~1027~90~37~48~58~5068~133~Ideal for a picnic, these sesame-speckled chicken wings are so good, you'll be happy to lick your fingers clean.
5009999~Greek Mussel and Potato Stew~1172~127~29~23~58~2550~47~"Northern Greeks, particularly those from Salonika, eat a lot of clams and mussels, usually as mezedes. Here's an easy-to-make dish from Greece's ""second city"" Cappetino."
5010000~Cracked Crab with Caviar Dipping Sauce~301~16~12~11~18~1517~160~For the start or close of a millennium (or almost any other significant occasion), this is an opulent but fuss-free combination. Purchase the crabs from a busy fishmonger to ensure absolute freshness. Inexpensive caviar (which is often dyed) can turn the dipping sauce gray; invest a little more if you can. Champagne — not too dry — is naturally the beverage of choice.

5010005~Grilled Vegetable and Rice Salad with Fish-Sauce Vinaigrette~4475~928~28~83~31~9505~54~All of these dishes would benefit from a scoop of rice on the side, but Pelaccio's twist on northeastern Malaysia's rice salad is meant to be served over the grains. (He prefers jasmine.) The smoky grilled vegetables are enlivened by a generous final flourish of fresh herbs.
5010006~Grilled Lamb Kebabs With Turkish Flavors~4626~411~288~199~257~7216~735~Serve these skewers with grilled pita and yogurt mixed with a little Maras pepper, olive oil, and chopped mint.

5010018~Maple Baked Apples with Dried Fruit and Nuts~1494~227~184~10~63~442~94~This is a simple, delicious dessert that also makes a warming and special brunch dish or breakfast. Although many baked-apple recipes are on the lean side (my mother always ate them when she was dieting), my version is luxurious yet still homey. I stuff the apples with a mix of brown sugar, dried fruit, and nuts, then bake them in a sauce of apple cider, maple syrup, and plenty of butter, which cooks down to a rich, thick glaze. I like to use Cortlands here because of their good squat shape and their complex fruity flavor, but any firm, tart baking apple will do.

5010023~Sweet Potato Chilaquiles with Griddled Salsa Roja~2208~233~56~61~107~5396~168~Chilaquiles, the ever-popular Mexican casserole, was created to use up stale tortillas. Made with a good sauce, the tortillas come back to life, take on all the flavors, and provide a wonderful textural contrast. Although chilaquiles are usually prepared casserole style, I have seen them made to order with scrambled eggs and chorizo. I particularly enjoy chilaquiles as a brunch item served with margaritas, chilled Mexican beer, or a hearty sangria.
5010024~Spiced Fresh Orange and Honey Sorbet~2236~569~541~8~0~106~0~If you're stopping at a Greek market for ingredients, grab some butter cookies.

5010033~Honey-Glazed Baked Apples Filled with Dried Fruit~748~192~166~2~0~73~0~Using purchased mixed dried-fruit bits for the filling makes this comforting dessert a snap to prepare.

The mousse can be made up to 3 days in advance of serving.
5019854~Chocolate Cake~3926~309~211~117~273~1597~370~Chocolate Cake with fluffy Marshmallow Frosting is a fabulous birthday treat for children and adults alike. To make a layer cake, simply double the recipe below and use two cake pans.

5010041~The Spring Forward~106~12~12~0~5~239~4~The rosemary-infused vodka in this drink may sound fancy, but it couldn’t be easier to make. Start it a day before you want to make the drink.
5010042~Chicken Alfredo with Zucchini Ribbons~2911~354~59~129~114~4573~227~Fettuccine Alfredo, with its ribbons of pasta coasted in a luxurious cheese sauce, is the very definition of decadent comfort.

5010054~Beets with Balsamic Vinegar~893~33~31~0~82~2638~0~"The faint sweetness and low acidity of balsamic vinegar is a perfect foil for the earthy taste of beets. For the recipe, there's no need to invest in an expensive real balsamic vinegar (labeled ""tradizionale""); a decent mass-produced commercial brand works just fine. Baking, rather than boiling, the beets brings out their robust flavor."

That alone taught me every possible shortcut to speed up the cooking process: For instance, slicing raw potatoes to reduce boiling time, pounding meat thin so it cooks more quickly, and of course, the mise en place — getting everything prepped so you're just reaching for ingredients at the last minute."""

5010072~Nancy's Falafel Pistachios~4320~43~0~1~441~5879~0~Before I left for my trip to Israel with Steven, I had a meeting with the California Pistachio Board. They were planning a lunch at my restaurant Chi Spacca to showcase recipes I was developing that highlighted pistachios. I told them I would soon be on my way to Israel and would return with at least one Israeli recipe to add to the mix because I knew that the pistachio was the peanut of not only Israel but the entire Middle East. Indeed, pistachios were sold at nearly every market I visited in Israel and were widely deployed—and enjoyed—in many dishes. This particular recipe was inspired by the falafel I ate at the wonderful Arab market in Akko. It was so striking that after asking the falafel man what spices were involved, I went to the spice guy at the same market and requested that he recreate the blend. I was a bit concerned that he would not be able to duplicate the mix. But it turned out that my request was not unique. He quickly began grinding away as if he had done this a thousand times. My request was merely the one thousand first.

5010089~Boeuf Bourguignon~3649~338~170~120~196~6001~367~·Boeuf bourguignon may be made 1 day ahead. Cool, uncovered, then chill, covered (it tastes even better made ahead because it gives the flavors time to develop). If making ahead, it's easier to remove fat from surface after chilling.

5010092~Cider-Braised Cabbage~746~131~106~0~26~1361~63~Braising the cabbage in cider gives it a light but distinct apple flavor.

5010096~Grilled East Coast Oysters with Corn Jalapeño Salsita~575~48~27~14~33~493~5~I've been a big fan of the plump and succulent wonders of oysters for a long time—since even before I started frequenting one of my favorite raw bars: the one in the Blue Ribbon, in Tribeca. Something about the charm of this particular example of our sea's bounty has always intrigued me. These days I prefer local (like Cape Cod) over other types of oysters, but, still, I'm open! The accompanying salsita—which is tasty all by itself or even spread on a small salad of your favorite greens—offers a wonderful flavor and texture balance. I suggest making the accompanying sauce ahead of time so you can visit with your guests. Then just grill the oysters, plate them, and serve.
5010097~Orange Tapioca Pudding~1234~94~84~35~80~889~612~The unique texture of tapioca—creamy pudding studded with soft, slightly chewy pearls—inspires intense devotion among fans.

The soup is bright and fresh and can be made year-round since it tastes just as good when using frozen corn as it does when using fresh.
5010105~Croque-Monsieur~1736~96~35~78~106~3062~333~Offer a plum-tomato salad with the sandwiches. Round out the meal with sliced strawberries drizzled with crème de cassis.

5010119~California Date Shakes~2894~367~317~39~134~739~482~Be sure not to overblend — the little bits of fruit add a pleasant textural contrast. The pitted dates available in supermarkets work well.
5010120~Poppy Seed Chocolate Torte~2080~266~229~21~108~364~581~Though similar in texture to a flourless chocolate cake, the addition of poppy seeds makes this torte delightfully different.

5010124~Squid in Vinegar Sauce~440~33~5~6~32~4043~0~New York Filipinos are sentimental about adobo — meat or fish with lots of garlic, soy sauce, and vinegar. We used cider vinegar to good effect, but authentic Filipino cuisine calls for coconut, palm, or sugarcane vinegar.

5010137~Asian Pear and Frisée Salad~994~122~78~3~55~27~0~Juicy Asian pear and a balsamic reduction play against the bitter edge of frisée—further mellowed by leeks hot from the pan.

At the restaurant, house-made gnocchi is used in this delicious dish.

5010153~Turkey with Lemon-Sage Butter~850~14~4~9~81~599~248~This easy-to-cook bird shows off the traditional flavors of the holiday; it's one of our favorites.
5010154~Quick Sausage and Mushroom Lasagna~3006~169~40~207~167~11743~210~If possible, use flat no-cook lasagna noodles: They look and taste more like homemade than the curly kind.
5010155~Spiced Lamb in Pita~1192~131~82~60~49~4215~226~Mix chopped cucumber and tomato into plain yogurt for spooning into the pita. Also offer couscous salad and marinated vegetables from the deli. Round out the meal with baklava and grapes.

5016310~Chile-Ginger-Mint Jellies~2473~357~282~11~94~93~314~If suave and hipster-hot is your idea of a dessert, you've just found it. These chile-ginger-mint jellies are an almost academic study in the contrasting sensations of hot and cool. The Chinese consider ginger to be hot—it's the source of heat in hot and sour soup—but Americans tend to view ginger more as a fresh, zinging accent of flavor. Add some fresh chile to the ginger and you introduce a new dimension of complexity that's counterbalanced by the cooling aspect of mint. The result? Your taste buds are rewarded with the dynamic duo of fiery hot and icy cold, all in one bite.

This is an adaptation of one of his favorite recipes to enjoy at home. For a wonderful spring stew, try adding some blanched asparagus, peas, and beans, or top it with a crust for a comforting pie .
5010170~Peanut Butter-Berry Pie~2637~439~365~60~78~649~405~Peanut butter, eggs and milk deliver 13 grams of protein in each slice of this pie. Your body uses more energy to process protein than it does for fat or carbs—now get to work!

It's time to come clean—and this finger-licking-good burger is so much more satisfying than those greasy drive-through hockey pucks. Plus grass-fed beef is leaner and lower in calories than conventional beef. It even contains a unique fat that may help prevent cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Talk about an afternoon delight.
5010178~Salmon Fillets with a Wasabi Coating~1140~162~17~26~41~857~77~I adore the kick that wasabi gives to anything in its path. Get it in powder form and add slowly to dressings or mayonnaise, or if anyone you know goes to Japan, get them to bring you back the toxic green stuff in a tube.
5010179~Lemon-Herb Chicken with Roasted Potatoes and Easy Caesar Salad~2728~372~67~61~101~11082~60~Highly recommended!

5019463~Baked Cheese Grits~3085~425~47~65~121~6471~645~The grits mixture will almost fill the entire baking dish and will puff up when baking, but don't worry — it won't overflow. Also, switching sides, these grits can take the place of mashed potatoes anytime.

I thoroughly enjoy giving sit-down meals, including an annual Christmas luncheon I do for about twenty guests. I just like to cook, period. Cooking for two hundred may be different from making weeknight dinners for myself and my husband, John, but organization is the key to both. I try to keep things on hand that are simple and easy to prepare."""

Instead of using salt, coat the glass rims with superfine sugar: Run a lime wedge along the rims to moisten, then dip them into a shallow saucer of sugar.

5010201~Pear, Chocolate, and Hazelnut Crostata~1070~155~124~16~40~797~53~For best results, use Bosc pears: They hold their shape well when baked. Top with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

5010203~Salumi with Peaches and Watercress~1906~134~119~15~148~1967~28~Salumi refers to all dry-cured Italian-style meats and sausages. Great chefs such as Tom Colicchio, Lidia Bastianich, Mario Batali, and Paul Bertolli are introducing them to a new generation of Americans, who may not realize what an incredible variety is available. Thanks to these chefs for bringing this artisan tradition back to the culinary fore. What an inspiration! One summer when I traveled in Italy, I was served salumi with peaches just about everywhere I went and although it was a combination I had never before tried, it made perfect and delicious sense and stayed with me after I returned to Chicago.
5010205~Asparagus Velouté~5476~1071~10~33~95~4134~336~Highly recommended!
5010206~Quick Chicken Paella with Sugar Snap Peas~2313~429~48~51~40~10247~62~This streamlined version of the classic Spanish dish comes together in about an hour—and doesn't require a special paella pan. Sugar snap peas add fresh flavor and nice crunch.
5010207~Wild Mushroom Pizza~1446~53~6~79~97~2376~338~Highly recommended!
5010208~Creamy Broccoli and Carrot Slaw~1218~188~55~86~31~1495~47~To make this easy dish even easier, prepare just the dressing and use two cups of packaged broccoli, coleslaw, a mixture of shredded broccoli stems, carrots and red cabbage.
5010209~Root Vegetable Tagine with Sweet Potatoes, Carrots, Turnips, and Spice-Roasted Chickpeas~2214~307~147~16~53~13850~0~A classic Moroccan tagine (or stew) is typically made with meat.

5010216~Shakshuka a la Doktor Shakshuka~1119~94~31~12~69~7046~370~"In 1930, Simon Agranat, the chief justice of the Israeli Supreme Court, wrote to his aunt and uncle in Chicago: ""I had my eighth successive egg meal during my three-day journey through the Emek (the valley)."" Eggs have always been a main protein for the people in Israel. When I lived in Jerusalem, I would make for my breakfast—or even for dinner—scrambled eggs with sauteed spring onions, fresh herbs, and dollops of cream cheese melted into the eggs as they were cooking. Probably the most popular egg dish in Israel is shakshuka, one of those onomatopoeic Hebrew and North African words, meaning ""all mixed up."" The most famous rendition of this tomato dish, which is sometimes mixed with meat but more often made in Israel with scrambled or poached eggs, is served at the Tripolitana Doktor Shakshuka Restaurant in Old Jaffa."
5010217~Chicken Soup~404~52~20~17~18~7244~62~Highly recommended!
5010218~Pasta with Green Vegetables and Herbs~3997~598~160~75~156~2918~10~Mixing aromatic herbs like mint and basil with asparagus and peas creates a beautiful green dish. Salty feta sparks it up.

5010221~Chicken in Spicy Coconut Sauce~581~55~25~8~31~4859~10~If you like curries, you'll love this recipe. The sauce is rich with coconut flavor and redolent with spice. Don't be alarmed by the number of red chiles — these are mild.
5010222~Grilled Tamales with Poblanos and Fresh Corn~2427~396~57~62~73~4012~158~Tamales—meat or vegetable fillings surrounded by masa dough and steamed in softened corn-husk packets—are a Latin American staple, and this rendition cleverly showcases corn in three distinct forms. Kernels of fresh sweet corn brighten up a dough made from corn tortilla flour. (Adding cornmeal to store-bought masa flour helps mimic the texture of fresh tamale dough, a trick we picked up from Magda Bogin at the Cocinar Mexicano cooking school in the town of Tepoztlán.) Poblano chiles add a touch of heat, but it's the time on the grill that gives the tamales real fire. The husks develop a light char, and the smoky flavor penetrates the tamale, accenting the corn in all its dimensions beautifully.
5010223~Sauteed Vegetables with Chile-Tamarind Sauce~1762~212~55~12~78~14264~44~The chile-tamarind sauce is a refined, complex variation on classic satay sauce, which is traditionally thickened with peanuts. This rendition owes its silky texture to mashed kabocha squash. At Arun's, this is served both as an appetizer and as a main course.
5010224~Sea Scallops with Spiced Bacon~1035~90~88~45~53~2064~146~Bacon and scallops always pair beautifully, but it's the mixture of sugar and spice that transforms these easy-to-make hors d'oeuvres.
5010225~Green Tomato Toast with Ricotta Salata and Lemon~562~73~25~22~18~1814~45~With super fresh tomatoes you don't need much more! This toast combines sharp ricotta salata cheese with plump green tomatoes and lemon juice for a refreshing bite. We like green zebra tomatoes for their pretty yellow stripes and bright, floral flavor, but any ripe green tomato will work in this dish.
5018725~Gourmet Magazine Grilling Procedures~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5010228~Double-Ginger Sour Cream and Bundt Cake with Ginger-Infused Strawberries~7953~1296~842~94~230~2685~880~Ground ginger and crystallized ginger amp up the flavor of the cake; fresh ginger adds a spicy hit to the fresh strawberries. The Bundt pan is coated with raw sugar before the batter is added, giving the cake a sparkly crust.
5010230~Pappardelle with Portobello Mushrooms, Spinach and Pine Nuts~13361~237~3~1189~942~42999~3094~This earthy pasta dish is delicious made with the wide, long noodles called pappardelle, or with the thinner and more readily available fettuccine.

To watch it being made, and to learn how to make other Mediterranean classics, check out the video classes.
5010238~Apple Pie with Oat Streusel~3756~611~343~40~125~969~315~"The technique: Streusel—a crumbly mixture of flour, butter, sugar, and spices—often shows up on coffee cakes. The sweet, crunchy stuff also makes a great pie-topper.
The payoff: You have to roll out only one pie crust instead of two, and the streusel adds texture and flavor."
5010239~Moroccan Lamb Stew~717~100~49~4~27~1455~0~This fragrant stew is great over couscous.
5010240~Lime Tart with Blackberries and Blueberries~3322~526~313~59~102~620~631~A press-in crust makes this party-worthy dessert easy to put together. For a pretty presentation, don't cover the lime curd completely with berries. The contrast between the dark berries and the bright lime curd is striking.
5010241~Fried Calamari with Rouille, Cherry Peppers, and Lemon~4030~422~11~43~237~6952~258~Rouille is synonymous with bouillabaisse, the Provençal seafood soup. The rust-red sauce is traditionally prepared by blending chiles, garlic, olive oil, and breadcrumbs. This easy, mayonnaise-based version is delicious with fried fish and seafood.

5010246~Snap Pea Salad~301~61~31~10~2~1052~0~I admit that I'm hard on sugar snap peas. I get disappointed when they suck, of course, but I also get grumpy when they're anything less than perfect—unblemished, super sweet, and not a bit starchy. That's the curse of keeping high standards, I suppose: you're so rarely satisfied. When at last I do find perfect snap peas, I make this salad. I leave them raw—only the finest snap peas can be this delightful without a dunk in boiling water—and accentuate their flavor with little more than a lemony dressing and mint. If you'd like, you could add some creamy goat cheese in blobs or good old burrata alongside.

5018276~Grilled Corn on the Cob with Glove-Box Recado~71~13~6~2~1~204~0~Chilly as July and August can be in San Francisco, you know it's summer when this delicious corn hits the Tacolicious menu. (It is so good that it transports you to sunshine, even if the city is socked in by fog and you're wearing a scarf.) If you already have the recado ready to go, this recipe is a cinch to make. Although the smokiness of the grill imparts great flavor, you can instead briefly boil the corn ears, halve them, and toss them with the recado-lime juice mixture. With the lime and the spices, no butter is needed. Try swapping out the corn for another vegetable, such as summer squash. To keep this recipe in the snack realm, chop the ears into thirds.
5010258~Baked Eggs with Zucchini Ragoût~2415~278~138~81~108~2708~632~Low-fat mozzarella cheese makes this a rich-tasting dish for brunch or a simple supper.
5010259~Cosmopolitan Cocktail~563~212~4~0~1~90~1~Highly recommended!
5010260~Corn Fritters with Arugula and Warm Tomato Salad~1055~68~30~35~74~2174~28~We found that using finely stone-ground cornmeal yielded a denser, slightly heavier fritter than regular stone-ground cornmeal. Though both tasted the same, we preferred the texture of the fritter made with regular cornmeal.
5010261~Mango-Macadamia Nut Ice-Cream~2803~281~276~16~164~431~661~Be sure to use extra-ripe mangoes when preparing this rich, creamy dessert.
5010262~Glazed Pork Chops with Spiced Onion Marmalade~542~74~32~16~9~3233~52~"""My husband and I went on our first date at Tuscarora Mill in Leesburg, Virginia, more than ten years ago,"" Jay Lewis of Charlotte, North Carolina. ""A few years later, we held the rehearsal dinner for our wedding there. To this day, every time we visit our family in nearby Waterford, we have dinner at Tuscarora Mill. The pork chop with onion marmalade is my favorite entrée."""
5010264~Roasted Garlic Soup with Parmesan Cheese~2159~119~34~52~154~2764~338~Highly recommended!
5010265~Roast Leg of Lamb with Mint, Garlic, and Lima Bean Purée~824~69~0~0~55~0~0~Your butcher can butterfly the lamb for you. What to drink: Bordeaux-blend reds, such as Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon, are the perfect match.
5010266~Green Olive Pesto~911~16~0~9~98~26579~24~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5010267~Smoked-Paprika Pork Rib Roast with Sherry Raisin Vinaigrette~1166~54~36~1~110~7759~0~Peppers from the valley of La Vera, in Extremadura, are used to produce a deliciously smoky paprika. There are three kinds of pimentón: sweet, bittersweet (called agridulce), and hot. We prefer agridulce in this recipe.
5017662~Toasted Salted Pumpkin Seeds~2990~33~0~168~249~2162~0~Besides serving these crunchy pumpkin seeds in our chili and chopped salad, we love to make up a batch to keep on hand as a snack.
5017171~Ricotta Whipped Potatoes~3723~672~134~67~74~20175~158~"This recipe was created to accompany <epi:recipelink id=""14115"">Rib-eye Steaks with Arugula Oil</epi:recipelink>."
5010273~Caramelized-Onion Pizza with Mushrooms~874~16~9~8~90~482~64~Highly recommended!
5010274~Grain Bowls With Chicken, Spiced Chickpeas, and Avocado~8979~947~170~248~494~18564~586~A store-bought rotisserie chicken brings you one step closer to a nourishing grain bowl dinner.
5010275~Cornell~312~87~0~9~0~195~4~Highly recommended!
5010276~Cheddar Dill Puffs~1409~112~10~65~108~3148~617~We like to think of these as an American version of gougères.
5010278~Key Lime Cheesecake with Tropical Dried-Fruit Chutney~1654~243~239~15~73~297~496~Highly recommended!
5010279~Springtime Bow Ties with Ham and Asiago~4097~399~39~189~165~8234~715~Serve with: Tomato salad and crusty semolina bread. Dessert: Amaretti cookies.
5010280~Tomato-Anchovy Pasta~1227~57~17~49~90~1790~118~Highly recommended!
5010281~Maple-Glazed Turkey with Dijon Gravy~3068~348~220~19~176~5041~473~Maple syrup, marjoram, coriander seeds, and lemon peel flavor a do-ahead butter that is spread on the turkey before baking. That same butter is also added to the Madeira-laced gravy. Grape clusters or steamed baby vegetables, such as carrots and squash, make a pretty garnish for the platter.
5014469~Gingered Mint Pesto~3222~559~342~0~110~0~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5017349~Cranberry-Mint Tea~1285~328~254~0~0~0~0~This is also very good served hot.
5010286~Black Bean Soup with Cumin and Jalapeño~511~53~12~2~30~2119~0~"Jennifer Smith of Tyler, Texas, writes: ""Now that I'm a stay-at-home mom, I cook more than I used to. My husband and I have discovered that dining out with a 16-month-old is messy at best, so we tend to eat in. Even then, cooking is a challenge, since my daughter is always underfoot."
5010287~Herbed Crepes with Smoked Salmon and Radishes~631~43~13~23~42~801~104~All but the most experienced of crêpe chefs will admit that the first crêpe in a batch is often not of the best quality. The level of heat under the skillet needs to be fine-tuned as you go. With that in mind, our recipe makes enough batter for 2 crêpes, even though you'll only need 1 for this hors d'oeuvre. If the first crêpe comes out well, freeze the extra, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, to use another evening.
5010290~Mocha Mousse with Kumquat Cranberry Sauce and Phyllo Pecan Crisps~2860~404~303~42~140~501~606~In this recipe there will be extra mousse and pecan crisps (the recipes will not work if reduced). Both elements are delicious on their own.
5010291~Tahini Chicken Salad~1124~91~20~35~64~5215~45~This salad is so much lighter and fresher-tasting than mayonnaise-based versions. It gets crispy sweetness from sugar snaps and peppers and nuttiness from tahini. Keep in mind that tahini can turn rancid rather quickly (even in unopened cans, in our experience). We recommend buying it from a place with a high turnover, such as a Middle Eastern market or a natural foods store.
5010293~Pork, Mushroom, and Snow-Pea Stir-Fry~1406~67~19~91~85~3672~204~Sizzling with fresh ingredients, this lively Asian stir-fry keeps prep time to a bare minimum without sacrificing flavor.
5010294~Espresso Chocolate Sablés~1163~285~52~94~29~1193~22~My original recipe for these deeply coffee-flavored and amply chocolate-flecked cookies produced a classic shortbread with the melt-in-your-mouth texture that’s the hallmark of great shortbread and the result of using only confectioners’ sugar in the dough. When I adapted the recipe for Beurre & Sel and baked the cookies in metal rings, constraining their spreadability, the change was anything but subtle: The sablés were still tender, but their texture became denser and their flavor more intense.
5010295~Indian Shrimp Curry~1457~62~19~195~44~2994~1761~You can tell this recipe hails from a tropical environment because of the way the first bite of chiles causes a light sweat to break out on your brow. Then a breeze blows by, and— ahh—you're instantly cooled off and refreshed, able to fully enjoy the sweetness of plump shrimp and an evolving harmony of spices.
5010296~Steamed Mussels with Tomatoes and Garlic Toasts~874~35~10~2~82~53~0~To debeard the mussels, just pull off the hairlike bits coming out of the shell.
5010297~Meat Loaf Plus~1702~170~37~77~66~11912~593~Highly recommended!
5011548~Seared Rosemary Scallops~324~2~0~15~27~159~31~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5010300~Carrot-Beef Sushi with Caper-Basil Mustard~886~76~30~5~55~1531~0~Trompe l'oeil as much as hors d'oeuvres, these rolls use carrot where nori would usually be at a sushi bar and boneless beef top loin instead of tuna. The pungent mustard sauce is an artful counterpoint to the sweet carrot.
5010301~Sheet-Pan Crispy Fish Tacos With Chili-Roasted Corn~4391~299~18~190~284~8376~496~Skip the mess of deep frying. Pumpkin seed- and panko-crusted fish stays extra crispy when baked on a cooling rack set over a baking sheet, which allows air to circulate around the pieces.
5010302~Date Squares~6596~1133~883~134~240~2432~584~Active time: 30 min Start to finish: 3 hr

5010304~Greek-Style Cucumber and Yogurt Dip with Dill~970~143~42~31~23~7210~35~Tangy and refreshing, this dip is called tzatziki in Greek. Here, it's served with crisp baked pita wedges, but it also goes well with crudités. Drain the yogurt a day before you plan to prepare the dip. And mix up a big batch of lemonade to pour throughout the picnic.
5010305~Duck Legs Confit Cooked in a Pouch (“Confit” de Canard en Sous Vide)~264~0~0~9~21~23816~144~Traditional duck confit is not only cooked in fat but also preserved for a period of time. A true confit has a unique flavor developed as it ages in duck fat. You can make it the traditional way, buy ready-made confit, or use the cooking method described here, called sous vide (under vacuum).
5010306~Walnut-Blackberry Torte with Mocha Buttercream~3743~165~127~69~316~1621~585~Highly recommended!
5010307~Guinness Stout Ginger Cake~3661~541~321~99~175~4389~370~The recipe for this moist, dark, fragrant gingerbread pays tribute to Dona Abramson and Stuart Tarabour at the Bright Food Shop, a terrific little Mexican-fusion café in Chelsea where I spent some time. This was my favorite of their desserts, and it has since become a seasonal classic at Gramercy Tavern, though I've made a few adaptations and embellished a bit. My recipe has just a touch of cloves, and instead of just the ginger and cinnamon in a typical gingerbread, I use a panoply of spices, including cardamom, nutmeg, and a lot of fresh ginger, to give the cake a racy, intriguing flavor.
5010308~Watercress Salad with Cotija Cheese and Fried Tortillas~1116~84~36~31~76~2587~112~If you can't get cotija cheese, you can substitute feta — it's stronger in flavor and a bit saltier than cotija, but it works fine. Archibald also makes a version of this salad topped with shavings of Manchego cheese.
5010310~Pumpkin Plum Tart~1498~141~134~12~104~702~684~A thin layer of plum jam beneath the custard is visually gorgeous—it's a magenta pinstripe just under the pumpkin orange—and provides a surprisingly delicious twist, since the tart plums bring out the best in all the other traditional flavors of pumpkin pie.
5010311~Sweet-Potato Sticks with Mustard Seeds and Ginger~6483~1209~235~117~111~36276~0~Fresh ginger and yellow mustard seeds make these sweet potatoes much more worldly than their candied incarnations. The cilantro takes them in an unexpected but very welcome direction.

5010315~Smoked Peppered Mackerel and Sour Cream on Homemade Potato Chips~806~76~15~8~51~2280~0~Store-bought potato chips, heated to crisp and refresh, would make this a very quick hors d'oeuvre.

5010320~Pine Nut Vinaigrette~461~20~10~7~41~13~0~A quick-to-make vinaigrette that's great tossed with greens and poured over steamed vegetables or orange slices. Present it in an antique glass cruet.
5010321~Herbed Rack of Lamb with Parsley, Mint, and Walnut Sauté~3168~234~116~25~237~3907~0~"Have the butcher ""french"" the lamb racks, which entails trimming the fat from the lamb and between the bones."
5010322~Creamed Spinach Deluxe~1093~79~33~14~71~1569~255~Highly recommended!
5010323~Whole Roasted Snapper with Artichokes and Aïoli~8669~112~9~12~941~4265~4~Highly recommended!
5010324~Pâte Sucrée~1042~271~0~129~23~698~82~Adding egg yolks, cream, and sugar transforms a standard crust into something almost cookie-like. Freeze the second crust for later use.
5010325~Clam, Chard, and Bacon Pizza~1420~45~2~70~98~3143~228~To easily roll out chilled store-bought dough, soften it first on a baking sheet set over a bowl of hot water.

5010331~Mulled Pears and Apples~7360~1779~1710~0~30~808~0~Core the fruit from the bottom so that the stems stay intact and the fruit looks whole on the platter.
5010332~Cream Gin Fizz~352~104~18~1~1~42~5~Highly recommended!
5010333~Tuna, Fennel, Avocado, and Tangerine Salad with Citrus Vinaigrette~886~27~13~25~74~1506~63~Taste restaurant is something of an anomaly in Tinseltown: low-key, affordable and friendly; the hostess smiles whether you're wearing Chanel or Old Navy. It's no wonder that stars such as Cameron Diaz and Selma Blair like to dine here. This salad, from chef Cathy Halter, is loaded with omega-3 fatty acids, which may reduce heart disease risk.
5010334~Greek Yogurt Bourekakia~13738~470~119~655~1000~29705~3605~These tender biscuit-like pastries are sprinkled with Greek cheese just before baking.

5010338~Stir-Fried Bok Choy~562~66~16~5~14~924~0~Nearly every family stir-fries bok choy year-round, but it’s also prized as a vegetable for such special occasions as New Year’s. The mastery here is in choosing young tender bok choy, no more than eight inches in length. Or, occasionally, you might get lucky enough to find hearts of bok choy, bok choy sum, in the produce market. Unlike the older bok choy, these vegetables are so tender that the stalks do not need to be peeled. Stir fry the vegetables on high heat just until the greens are bright and the stalks are tender. A minute too much, and the vegetables lose their essence. Bok choy found in Western supermarkets is often old and past its prime, while the bok choy available in Asian markets is far superior in quality and much less expensive.
5010339~Chilled Indian-Spiced Tomato Soup with Crabmeat~4865~462~98~396~99~252332~485~This soup can be pureed by pressing it through a strainer or a food mill. It can also be pureed in a blender and then strained.
5010340~Broiled Lemon Thyme Pollock~878~10~1~13~86~1392~176~Mayonnaise with lemon and thyme gives both extra freshness and a golden-brown crust to delicate, slightly sweet pollock.
5010341~Mojito-Marinated Chicken Breasts~767~121~37~18~14~6504~45~The popular rum-and-mint cocktail from Cuba was the inspiration for this entrée. A last-minute spritz of grilled lime adds even more flavor. Garnish with grilled pineapple slices cut into star shapes, if desired.
5010342~Parsley-Root Soup with Truffled Chestnuts~1480~120~31~6~113~5403~158~Floating on the surface of this pale, silky soup, which tastes of the essence of parsley, is a trompe l'oeil surprise: What looks like shaved truffles is actually thinly sliced chestnuts, adding a nutty sweetness.
5010343~Seafood Paella~4409~496~38~260~147~7736~1178~"""I go to Spain frequently, and I've tried many kinds of paella there,"" says Bruce Cummings of Baltimore, Maryland. ""Recently, though, I discovered an outstanding one right here in Baltimore, at Tio Pepe Restaurante."""

5010346~Poached Eggs in Tomato Sauce With Chickpeas and Feta~1595~72~8~12~135~4280~370~Popular in Israel, this shakshuka works for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

5010349~Barbecued Chicken and Chickpea Quesadillas~2175~178~49~112~116~8824~396~The barbecued chicken pizza Wolfgang Puck first served at Spago in Hollywood inspired this quesadilla, which we serve as a special at the Market. The combination seems kind of strange to people at first, but once they try it, they love it.
5010350~Grilled Shrimp and Caesar Salad~1417~88~19~137~51~4012~968~Highly recommended!
5010351~Southeast Asian Turkey Burgers~1579~144~18~75~72~5979~231~Looking to jazz up a backyard barbecue? The bold flavors in this burger will definitely get guests talking. A paste of lemongrass, garlic, ginger, and serrano chile enlivens ground turkey, while also helping to keep it moist. If you don't have a mini food processor, don't be discouraged. It may take longer, but it's still worth the effort to finely chop the ingredients and mash them to a paste using a mortar and pestle. A spicy lime vinaigrette takes the place of traditional condiments.
5010352~Corned Beef Sandwiches with Pickled Cabbage~1682~141~41~58~102~5195~205~Salt-and-vinegar chips and Guinness will turn this into a pub dinner.
5010353~Orecchiette with Spiced Duck Ragù~2869~417~38~109~97~2475~166~"The restaurant takes its name from amuse-bouche, a small gift from the chef to ""please the mouth."" Chicken thighs make a convenient substitute for duck in this pasta dish."

5010355~Mediterranean Chicken Salad~3108~171~33~126~229~104684~440~"Paulette Sexton of Tustin, California, writes: ""Although I've loved to cook since I was a kid, I didn't really hone my kitchen skills until my husband and I started entertaining frequently. When we were first married, we had dinner parties several times a week — it got to the point where people would call me around 4:30 in the afternoon and ask, 'What's for dinner?' We're still having people over and we're still informal, especially in the summer. Everyone sits around the large island in our kitchen, drinking wine and eating appetizers. Usually there's grilled chicken or fish or a simple main-course salad for dinner. It's our favorite menu."""
5010356~Whipped Cream Pastries with Jam and Coffee Glaze~967~185~140~5~28~334~0~These sweets are enjoyed with coffee or tea at Bewley's on Grafton Street, a Dublin institution that has long been part of the city's folklore and culture.
5010358~Fennel-Crusted Pork Chops with Potatoes and Shallots~2212~382~73~33~52~10107~0~Cutting the vegetables into similarly sized pieces helps them cook at the same rate, so this entire dish—sauce included—can be made in one pan.
5010359~Toasted Orecchiette With Veal Meatballs~4156~588~75~171~182~6770~296~If you prefer all-pork (or all-veal) meatballs, go ahead and make that change.
5010360~Plum Sherbert with Orange Juice and Plum Wine~2218~361~279~3~78~67~314~A pretty pink dessert that is refreshing and light. Plums with dark purple skin or flesh will give the sherbet beautiful color. Serve a pot of green tea alongside.
5010362~"Celery Root ""Anna"" with Bacon and Olives"~1061~3~0~58~87~2251~218~This dish was inspired by pommes Anna, the regal, crisp-crusted potato cake rumored to have been named for Anna Deslions, a famous courtesan in nineteenth-century Paris.
5015459~Chicken Liver Pâté~1536~52~7~76~103~558~1780~Leftover quatre épices from our Confit Duck Legs adds mellow depth to this smooth, velvety pâté spiked with Cognac. The classic flavors of this tried–and–true starter served with baguette toasts are sure to brighten any cocktail party.
5010364~Spicy Spiked Hot Chocolate~2114~205~190~20~131~1319~386~The addition of an anise-flavored liqueur turns this hot cocoa into the liquid version of chocolate-covered licorice.
5010365~Lobster and Confetti Vegetable Salad~2012~324~63~84~30~7915~0~The lobster and vegetables are tossed with an orange, shallot and tarragon dressing, then served over mixed green. Offer lavash crackers and white wine spritzers.

5010369~Sauteed Cod with Asparagus Sauce and Fennel~796~32~10~21~69~0~189~Melon wedges wrapped in prosciutto make a lovely first course; the garlic mashed potatoes, baked tomato halves topped with Parmesan, and an Italian Chardonnay are perfect with the fish. Offer an arugula salad after the main course, and fresh strawberries in grappa with lemon sorbet and biscotti for dessert.
5010370~Lime-Soy-Ginger Sauce~178~13~3~9~11~3154~0~This simple sauce goes well with spring rolls as a dipping sauce. Also, it makes a good marinade for seafood. I once served grilled trout marinated in this sauce to a friend who disliked fish—it completely changed his mind!
5010371~Asian Chicken Salad with Roasted Peanuts~1656~37~18~29~59~27040~0~Use leftover chicken if you have any on hand, or start with a rotisserie chicken. Be sure to pick up the sliced peppers from the salad bar while you're at the market. Crunchy sesame breadsticks are all you need to complete the meal — except, of course, dessert, which could be pineapple slices sprinkled with coconut and broiled.

5015927~Confit Duck Legs~234~46~6~0~0~23284~0~As convenient as store-bought duck confit is, we find that its quality tends to vary. Making your own allows you to control the spicing and the cooking time to produce a velvety piece of meat. This ancient preservation method has three parts: First you cure the duck legs in salt (drawing out the water in which microorganisms can live), then you slowly cook them in fat, and finally you store them fully covered in the cooking fat so air can't get in.

5010432~"""Redeye"" Braised Lamb Shanks and Beans"~3001~372~135~146~112~10266~182~Redeye gravy is traditionally made from ham drippings, water, and coffee, the last being an optional ingredient. Here we've enriched the savory braising liquid from lamb shanks with bacon (instead of ham drippings) for a new twist on an old favorite.

Here, it's a risotto dotted with black-eyed peas and flavored with bacon and pancetta. This is an unconventional method for making risotto — rather than slowly adding hot stock to the rice, Rollins adds it, unheated, in just 2 batches. This will allow you more time for preparing the chops that go along with it.

5010857~Saffron Alioli~1051~41~0~0~97~921~126~Alioli, a very popular Spanish sauce, goes well with almost anything—from grilled meat to vegetables to seafood. Although the authentic version is an emulsion of garlic and oil, eggs are commonly added (especially in restaurants) because they make the sauce less fragile and easier to whip up. We've made ours even easier by using store-bought mayonnaise.

5010469~Baked Chicken with Chile-Yogurt Marinade~567~56~6~38~19~2992~169~A platter of marinated chicken is always a popular buffet item, and I've been serving this at my parties for years. Choose cilantro, basil, or even parsley to fit your fancy or your guests' taste (I have cilantro-haters in my crowd, and you may, too). For the juiciest results, use bone-in, skin-on chicken. This marinade works well to protect skinless chicken from drying out — just reduce the baking time by a few minutes.
5010471~Duck Bigarade~2523~286~189~156~95~12959~885~This is a modern rendition of a nineteenth-century recipe that ultimately became the legendary canard a l'orange, though it bears little resemblance to the gloppy 1960s version of duck a l'orange served in this country. This is much lighter and just a little bitter. The sauce was originally made with sour Seville oranges (bigarade is the Provençal term for these sour citrus), and if you can find them, by all means use them. Citrus and waterfowl are a perfect pair, and they both happen to be in season at the same time. Any skin-on duck breasts will work with this recipe, but I prefer Muscovy or large wild duck breasts.
5010472~Apple Horseradish Aspic with Fennel~1363~331~319~14~0~1256~0~Highly recommended!

What to drink: Robust Pinot Noirs with firm acid (to cut the richness of this dish), such as French Burgundies from Volnay, and Oregon or California Pinots.

These skewers are wonderful grilled, but broiling under high heat is delicious too. If you use wooden skewers, soak them in water for at least 15 minutes before using them, so that they don’t burn before the chicken is cooked.

5010509~Italian Rice Pie (Pastiera di Riso)~4945~678~143~258~238~5283~742~"Italian wheat pies—filled with a rich ricotta custard studded with tender wheat berries—are associated with Easter celebrations, but according to author Gina Marie Miraglia Eriquez, rice pies are just as classic and in her estimation, taste better. Eriquez had been making wheat pies for years when she had some extra dough a while back and used it to make a rice pie. ""My family went berserk. They went crazy for it!"" said Eriquez with a laugh. ""Rice is more tender. It has a nicer taste than wheat,"" she explained. ""If you give my family a choice, they're going to ask for the rice before the wheat."" The pastry dough, pasta frolla, is delicate and tears easily, so if it softens, quickly chill it in the freezer for a few minutes. And don't worry about the tears; they patch easily."

5010600~Winter Minestrone~1351~286~147~35~0~5682~0~Patience is the key to this soul-satisfying soup chock-full of winter greens.

The result is so savory that there's no need for broth; water, canned tomatoes, and a parmesan rind work beautifully.

5010652~Huckleberry Mostarda~168~39~25~1~1~2~0~Smith slyly doctors the sweet-tart Italian condiment to gain an unmistakable berry flavor with a little tangy crunch.
5010653~Whole Grain Mustard Aïoli~1724~50~1~0~168~2799~253~Purchased mayo gets dressed up with garlic, Dijon, and lemon juice.
5010654~Cube Steaks Dijon~633~0~0~0~62~899~220~"Using pre-tenderized steak (labeled ""cube steak"" at the meat counter) makes this bistro-style dish extra succulent. Serve with: Hash browns and steamed broccoli. Dessert: Warm apple pie."

5010659~Spicy Braised Chicken with Mushrooms and Star Anise~592~104~67~41~14~4085~45~Just add steamed rice for a complete family-style Chinese dinner.
5010660~Eggplant Parmesan Heros~7831~309~9~312~694~9671~825~Active time: 1 1/2 hr Start to finish: 2 hr
5010661~Green Rice and Black Beans~4001~484~10~118~174~3948~406~Highly recommended!
5010662~Baked Oysters with Bacon~2381~137~15~50~171~958368~315~Stitt likes to use rock salt — the kind used for old-fashioned ice cream churners — as a bed for these oysters because it keeps the shells from tipping and sliding around in the pan and on the plates. Rock salt is sold at many supermarkets, but kosher salt is a good substitute.
5010663~Raspberry and Aperol Floats~1493~168~156~18~84~335~302~Aperol is similar to Campari but sweeter and less boozy. This recipe works with either one.
5010664~Grilled Chicken Wings With Shishito Peppers and Herbs~3385~16~12~263~247~1609~1035~Steady medium heat is best for grilling wings; they need time for the fat to render and the skin to crisp.
5015240~Zinfandel Beef Stock~1286~215~32~85~1451~111~1700~It's worth the extra effort to make this rich stock; the slow-simmered taste produces a sauce that far exceeds any made with canned beef broth.
5010666~Cherry-Almond Bars~5071~661~326~75~236~542~379~A bowl of fresh fruit and some mixed nuts would be very nice go-withs here.
5010667~South-of-the-Border Sundaes~1750~303~224~62~50~577~56~Store-bought vanilla frozen yogurt acts as the luscious foil for oranges, pineapple, mango and bananas in a fat-free brown sugar-cinnamon sauce.
5010668~Simple Shrimp, Coconut and Eggplant Curry~766~68~12~60~20~48787~455~Many of us love a curry, and this is my absolute favorite. It’s rich in flavor but won’t leave you in that post-curry slump. I love this because it’s so simple and everything’s made in one pot—perfect to share or enjoy alone, and I don’t think it needs any rice!

5010674~Indian Spiced Cauliflower and Potatoes~947~61~10~1~76~2372~0~Highly recommended!
5010675~Quick Raspberry Charlotte~3121~390~301~38~161~661~734~Saturated with brandy, cream, and raspberry purée, dried Italian-style savoiardi get the French treatment here.
5010676~Chianti-Braised Stuffed Chicken Thighs on Egg Noodles~3608~409~47~174~144~8478~802~A green salad completes the meal. What to drink: A riserva Chianti.

5010680~Bibb Lettuce, Avocado, and Dried Cranberry Salad~1421~73~50~3~126~659~0~"""Five years ago, I threw my first dinner party,"" writes Kristin McGill of Chicago, Illinois. ""It was a memorable night with good friends, great food and lots of wine. That night, cooking became my passion. And despite all of the effort, I still love to throw parties. My husband, Henry, and I host get-togethers once or twice a month. I do most of the preparation — admittedly that's because I enjoy cooking so much that I prefer to have the kitchen to myself. But I have to confess that since I started sharing the counter space, I've discovered we make a great team."""
5010681~Grilled T-Bone Steaks with Worcestershire-Chive Butter~899~18~3~0~92~1214~253~Highly recommended!
5010682~Watermelon, Cantaloupe, and Red Pepper Salsa~392~68~28~10~11~2232~0~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5010684~Grapefruit and Avocado Salad with Ginger-Cassis Dressing~587~16~5~1~56~417~0~Highly recommended!
5010686~Broiled Shrimp with Spicy Ginger-Lime Butter~490~3~1~49~31~745~519~The shrimp could also be skewered and grilled instead of broiled. Either way, they're lovely arranged atop pimiento-flecked rice pilaf and served with steamed snow peas and a basket of warm corn muffins. Blueberry or strawberry shortcakes are the perfect dessert.
5010687~Sauteed Red Snapper Fillets with Fennel and Orange~346~12~8~0~34~1~0~The fresh flavors of fennel and orange make this simple fish dish shine. You can serve it alone or with a helping of rice.
5010688~Slow-Baked Salmon with Avruga Caviar Sauce~534~2~2~28~44~733~167~Moderately priced avruga caviar (smoked herring roe from Spain) gives cooks a chance to throw caution to the wind and experiment. Stephen Harris purées it into a slate-gray emulsion, bringing visual drama and a smoky flavor to delicate salmon. Fleur de sel is a good substitute for his house-made sea salt.
5010689~Marinated Halibut on Radish Sprout and Fennel Salad~1054~65~37~0~89~7~0~The agrodolce (tart-and-sweet) flavors of vinegar and raisins used in marinating the fish are typical of Jewish-Italian cooking.
5010690~Hazelnut and Chocolate Pithiviers~2926~281~147~40~183~928~628~This dessert, prominent in the window of virtually every Paris pastry shop, is a true classic. The puff pastry rounds are usually filled with an almond mixture, but my version features hazelnuts and chocolate. Purchased pastry makes it approachable for the modern cook. Since it reheats nicely, the Pithiviers can be made ahead.
5010692~Chicken Cacciatora~650~59~17~2~41~2642~0~In this dish, Elena Rovera prefers the clean, fruity flavor of Roero Arneis, a dry white wine from the Piedmont region of Italy. She typically serves the chicken with rosemary potatoes.
5010693~Squid Risotto~1450~261~5~22~15~5244~0~Highly recommended!

5010696~Heirloom Tomato and Burrata Cheese Salad~756~9~3~10~76~547~71~This summer, Marino grew about 85 tomato varieties in his garden; he uses his harvest in this caprese. Burrata cheese, a fresh mozzarella filled with cream and curds, is available at some supermarkets, Italian markets, and cheese stores. Fresh whole-milk mozzarella can be substituted.
5010697~Steamed Savoy Cabbage and Mustard Greens with Bacon~2960~37~1~106~258~4996~485~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5010698~Pico de Gallo: Fresh Tomato Salsa~109~24~15~2~0~1720~0~Editor's note: Chef Roberto Santibañez, the chef/owner of Fonda in Brooklyn, New York shared this recipe as part of a festive taco party menu he created for Epicurious. He recommends serving this salsa with his Carnitas or Carne Adobada Tacos .

5010702~Crown Roast of Pork with Lady Apples and Shallots~6733~1375~1071~51~135~112549~182~Hold off on the holly sprigs. The only centerpiece your table needs is a showstopping crown roast of pork that's fit for a queen—and a crowd. Once you've got the two racks tied together, making this is as simple as any other roast.
5010703~Tropical Rainbow~758~185~170~0~5~127~0~This is an impressive three-layered popsicle. Make sure each layer is completely frozen before adding the next, as it looks great when the layers are really well defined.
5010876~Winter Fruit Chutney~1790~352~315~5~0~2627~0~This cinnamon-and coriander-spiced chutney combines wine, raisins and citrus. Serve with the Barbecue Turkey with Maple-Mustard Glaze, or as an appetizer with goat cheese and crusty bread.
5010705~Golden Fruitcake~11873~1624~967~144~557~1120~1129~This version of the much maligned Christmas classic is deliciously lacking in candied cherries, giant mixed nuts and citron, but it is filled with bits of marzipan and lots of appealing dried fruit. Baking the cakes in disposable aluminum loaf pans (available at supermarkets) or in decorative cardboard loaf pans (available at some cookware stores or by mail order) makes gift giving easy; just wrap each cake in its pan in cellophane, and add a colorful ribbon.
5010706~Chicken with Peppers and Tomatoes~760~51~12~29~45~3084~139~Highly recommended!

5018926~Irish Bacon~3045~0~0~139~273~6637~522~Irish bacon, sliced and packaged, is increasingly available at supermarkets. If you find it at the butcher counter, ask the butcher to slice it into 1/4-inch-thick slices.

5010734~Thai Chicken Stock~631~97~3~7~21~482~0~Active time: 45 min Start to finish: 4 hr
5013517~Stabilized Whole-Milk Yogurt~339~50~29~25~0~2445~22~Yogurt curdles easily when heated, but mixing it with egg white and cornstarch, and then simmering it, makes the yogurt more heat-stable without changing the flavor significantly.
5010736~Lamb and Parsley Patties~1740~177~140~102~74~3899~371~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5010737~Grilled Iceberg Wedges with Buttermilk-Basil Dressing~1243~10~18~45~74~1631~115~Inspired by the classic steakhouse wedge, this salad gets a double hit of smokiness thanks to the bacon and grilled iceberg.

5010739~Apricot-Glazed Chicken with Dried Plums and Sage~792~98~37~14~10~7787~370~This is an elegant way to make a whole lot of chicken that tastes really good. It's kind of sweet and sour—sweet from the apricot preserves and the plums, and sour from the bit of vinegar. But what makes this dish are the sage leaves. They give a distinctive taste and make it a beautiful, festive platter that you can really be proud of.
5010740~Thai-Style Iced Tea~667~57~56~3~50~157~171~Spiced tea and sweetened condensed milk are the keys here.
5010741~Rhubarb Collins~620~149~149~0~0~1~0~Jasper Soffer, bartender at the Mulberry Project in New York City, created this simple-to-prepare seasonal cocktail for our story Spring Cocktails Perfect for Brunch. The rhubarb simple syrup, Soffer explains, is simultaneously sweet and tart, not unlike a rhubarb-apple crumble or a strawberry-rhubarb pie. If you want to make this drink outside rhubarb's short early-spring season, frozen fruit makes a great substitute.
5010742~Chocolate-Covered Gingerbread Cake~5053~661~315~67~223~2271~886~So many German settlers carried their gingerbread treats to small towns around this country that the sweetly spiced cakes and cookies have become an all-American tradition. Coated with a chocolate ganache glaze, the homey cake of holidays past is transformed into a special-occasion dessert.
5010743~Blackberry and Nectarine Cobbler~821~103~31~29~46~899~86~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5010760~Roast Pork Lo Mein~645~34~11~10~45~4362~10~Lo mein is a noodle dish that often is confused with chow mein, and many Chinese restaurants further the confusion by using the two names interchangeably. The dishes are similar, both featuring noodles mixed with stir-fried meat and vegetables and a savory sauce. But whereas chow mein refers to parboiled and stir-fried noodles, lo mein refers to noodles that are fully cooked separately and quickly tossed with sauce in the wok. The roast pork in this recipe is char siu, the same gorgeous reddish-brown pork often displayed and sold in Chinatown shop windows. Instead of buying the pork ready-made, you can also roast your own at home. For the egg noodles, you can use any that are thin and round; spaghetti will also work.
5010761~New England Fish Cakes with Herbed Tartar Sauce~1727~136~9~80~85~5450~179~Serve with: Pickled beets and baby potatoes sprinkled with parsley. Dessert: Lemon bars from the bakery.

5010764~Cheese, Herb, and Sun-Dried Tomato Phyllo Rolls~1139~76~4~62~61~2337~181~Market tip: Many Greek cheeses are made with goat's milk or sheep's milk. Kefalotyri is hard and salty; Pecorino Romano is a good substitute. Kasseri is mild and firm; Parmigiano-Reggiano makes a good stand-in. You can find Greek cheeses at specialty foods stores, at Greek markets, and at igourmet.com.
5017084~Crown Roast of Lamb~1969~132~57~116~108~41079~257~Highly recommended!

5010773~Cumin-Chile Lamb Kebabs With Garlic Yogurt~2315~242~172~130~92~4624~468~A perfect cube is not essential, but try to get the lamb into roughly the same size pieces so they cook at the same rate.
5010774~Veal, Carrot and Chestnut Ragoût~1087~100~37~7~69~6228~0~Chestnuts are harvested in the area around Alba and figure in many savory and sweet dishes there, particularly stews like this ragout. Gathered after they have fallen, chestnuts are traditionally served with game, but they also pair well with veal-another staple of northern Italian cuisine. If fresh chestnuts are unavailable, roasted vacuum-packed chestnuts-sold in jars in the specialty foods section of many supermarkets-can be used. Supply crusty bread for soaking up the juices. Accompany with a radicchio and escarole salad, and uncork a Barolo.
5010776~Moroccan-Spiced Chicken Paillards~706~40~36~18~50~3121~108~Slightly sweet, tangy, and spicy all at once, the easy sauce doubles the flavor of quick-cooking thin-sliced chicken breasts.

5010779~Cucumber and Raisin Relish with Mustard Seeds~770~138~120~4~9~4326~17~Golden raisins add a bright sweetness to this fresh take on sweet-and-sour pickles. Serve it with our Cider-Brined, Maple-Glazed Pork Loin, spread it onto sandwiches, or use it to top hot dogs.
5010782~Yummy Mummy Meatloaf~2822~452~200~112~61~7761~133~This mournful relic makes a silly entrée everyone will enjoy.

5010795~French 75 Cocktail II~91~0~0~0~0~0~0~This intoxicating champagne cocktail was named after a French 75-millimeter gun used in World War I. Many American bartenders claimed to have invented the drink. One recipe, from 1919, called for absinthe, Calvados, and gin, but no champagne. Supposedly, the champagne version was introduced at Harry's New York Bar in Paris in 1925. Or the cocktail might have originated with American soldiers in Paris, who added gin and liqueur to champagne to crank up its potency.

5010800~Crab Salad with Sun-Dried Tomato Louis Dressing~3065~154~52~166~227~98963~1178~It’s unclear just who the Louis of Crab Louis salad fame was; perhaps he was affiliated with the Olympic Club in Seattle, where opera star Enrico Caruso, who visited there in 1904, is said to have fallen in love with the crab salad. San Francisco also claims the dish, which reached its zenith there in the teens, as a specialty at Solari’s restaurant and at the St. Francis Hotel.
5010801~Peach Raspberry Smoothie~471~120~110~1~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5010802~Tea-Marbled Eggs With Soy Balsamic Mayonnaise~1115~47~30~31~94~10405~496~Tea-marbled eggs are a time-honored part of Chinese cuisine. The outer shell of a hard-boiled egg is cracked (but not removed), and the egg is then soaked in tea, which gives it a lovely marbled appearance and subtle smoky flavor. We found traditionally cooked tea-marbled eggs — usually simmered for an hour — were too tough for our taste; this method yields more tender whites.
5010803~Tenderloin Steaks with Cranberry-Port Sauce and Gorgonzola Cheese~1778~153~69~49~99~21193~275~Highly recommended!

5010806~Spinach Shakshuka~654~55~7~6~44~3039~0~"Since I was little, I have thrilled at reading food-related passage in novels. But the food scenes in Some Day by Israeli novelish Shemi Zarhin are on another level. In one passage, Zarhin describes a dish so vividly, I felt compelled to re-create it in my own kitchen He writes: ""Ruchama...fried onions and sprinkled garlic cloves...seasoned it with spicy green pepper and coriander seeds and squeezed a lemon and placed a pile of beet leaves...in the middle, and within seconds, the green pile sunk into the pot and became an aromatic green sauce, into which Ruchama chopped cubes of sheep's milk cheese and broke three eggs and dripped olive oil."" As I read and my mouth watered, I realized that Ruchama is essentially making a tomato-free version of the North African poached egg dish, shakshuka. Riffing off the ""recipe,"" I experimented with a spinach shakshuka and, like Ruchama, ended up mopping it up with pita ""with great pleasure."""

5010814~Lobster, Corn, and Potato Salad with Tarragon~658~35~24~5~56~1309~0~Buy cooked fresh lobster meat and you can whip this salad together in about 30 minutes. Cooking your own lobster, however, not only ensures the freshest flavor and the tenderest meat, but you get more bang for the buck—you can use the lobster shells to make stock and lobster oil.
5010815~Lobster and Pineapple Salad with Basil and Mint~1157~112~23~10~63~3586~0~It's best to serve this lobster salad right after you make it, rather than preparing it in advance. If the salad stands for more than half an hour, pineapple enzymes will alter the texture of the lobster meat.

5010818~Cobb Salad with Balsamic Shallot Vinaigrette~3076~48~21~84~292~5039~677~It is a salad, but cobb salad was never meant to be a healthful or low-fat dish. Because Ryan Howard is a conscientious eater, however, this version is a lighter version that still packs some punch from the familiar flavors of the original. Use reduced-fat blue cheese and turkey bacon, serve the dressing on the side, and dig into this classic mega-salad.
5010819~Fall Salad of Corn, Cherry Tomatoes, and Oven-Roasted Green Onions~7439~1086~34~151~303~762~0~The salad components can be made a day ahead and assembled just before serving.

5016469~Quinoa and Asparagus Salad with Mimosa Vinaigrette~2594~359~96~56~106~2211~380~Quinoa is native to the Andes, not the Middle East, so it was unknown to the Jews fleeing Egypt during biblical times. With the recent rise of quinoa's popularity in the United States, and the fact that it's not a true grain but rather the seed of a broadleaf plant, some circles of Judaism have approved of and welcomed it to the Passover table, while others have not. If you feel comfortable serving it this Passover, you will love how it absorbs the vinaigrette, bright with lemon and enriched with finely grated hard-boiled eggs, and how it forms a tender bed for the ribbons of scallion and raw asparagus.
5018675~Basic Crab Stock~781~55~12~1~62~1071~0~Editor's note: Use this crab stock to make Chef John Besh's Basic Crab Pan Sauce for his Busters and Grits recipe.

Alsace's dry Riesling lends a gentle richness to this creamy, comforting meal.

It's an interest I share with my daughter, Hannah. We do a phenomenal amount of cooking together.

Now Hannah's early training is paying off: She creates new recipes often, including the peanut butter and white chocolate candies here."""

Here, I've panfried it to crisp the edges and draped it in a velvety Vietnamese-style caramel sauce. A shower of fresh herbs and browned shallots gives it an extra layer of flavor. If you prep the herbs and make the sauce ahead, you can put this on the table in under half an hour.
5010886~Herb-Roasted Chicken with Lemon and Sage~1396~35~15~1~143~1893~0~We hit upon our favorite recipe a few summers back, when we helped out a buddy with his annual Labor Day pig roast in Connecticut. In addition to the 125-pound porker we were planning to serve, we decided we should have some chicken just in case not everyone at the party wanted to partake of the sacred swine. We got about 100 birds, halved them, and soaked them in a simple marinade of just lemon, sage, and cracked black pepper. It turned out to be one of the first times—maybe the only time—there was a pig roast where chicken was the hit of the day. What really made it special was the marinade. It lent a nice acidity to the meat, which became really tender, and the sage and lemon flavors just exploded. For the most classic presentation, roast a whole bird and carve it tableside. If you want an especially crispy, golden-skinned chicken, have your butcher halve it, and roast the halves skin side up so they can self-baste as they roast.
5010887~Iced Vodka with Cucumber, Lemon, and Mint~3062~920~220~7~30~1541~35~This one can also be a spritzer. Pour into a collins or highball glass and top with a little club soda.

If you like, steam the couscous with a large pinch of saffron.
5010905~Spanish Anchovy, Fennel, and Preserved Lemon Salad~1436~10~6~47~137~1608~134~Spanish anchovies in vinegar (boquerones) are milder than salted anchovies and have a light pickled taste. They are available in the refrigerated section of some specialty foods stores and online from markys.com.

5010911~Cowboy Beans~486~54~27~3~30~1628~0~During roundups, cowboys once saved any extra coffee for use in cooking, since water was sometimes scarce. The coffee powder in these beans is an adaptation of that. Add some hot buttered flour tortillas and a crisp salad alongside for a terrific meal.
5010912~Angel Hair with Lemon, Kale, and Pecans~4393~449~75~98~250~10251~48~When kale started to take over the food world, I noticed it was juiced, made into chips, put into smoothies, and even sneaked into chocolate bars. So why not put it in a pasta dish? The nuts in this recipe give the dish another layer of flavor and a nice crunchy texture. The bitter, citrus, crunch, and chili all combine for a unique pasta.
5010913~Potato Gratin with Porcini Mushrooms and Mascarpone Cheese~4561~244~19~35~367~381~820~Over-the-top delicious.
5010914~Baked Cod and Potatoes with Horseradish Cream Sauce~818~11~3~0~84~1868~126~Lighten up: To reduce the fat and calories in the cod, substitute 1/3 cup light mayonnaise for the 1/2 cup regular mayo called for.
5010915~Oxtail Soup with Red Wine and Root Vegetables~4070~172~43~880~918~20163~2996~During hard times, luxury cuts like steaks and chops give way to humbler ones. None are humbler than the oxtail, and all across the country, depression-era cooks made much of it, frequently in soup. Even in these days, when humble cuts have become restaurant menu stars, soup is still a good way to go with oxtails. Simmering them slowly with garlic and vegetables in red wine yields a rich broth and tender, succulent meat, making a lavish feast for us all.
5010916~Blueberry Lemon Pound Cake~2635~416~414~12~105~3569~584~Highly recommended!
5010917~Chicken Sauté with Paprika Sauce~321~14~7~18~20~1719~92~Steamed Swiss chard and buttered egg noodles sprinkled with chives are nice sides for this Hungarian-inspired meal. Apple strudel makes the perfect dessert.
5010918~Chocolate-Chip Ice-Cream-Sandwich Cake with Butterscotch Sauce~10269~1350~885~117~494~3946~1407~Here's a party-size ice cream sandwich that everyone will love. We use two 9-inch-diameter cake pans so that the cookies keep their round shape when baking. And there's no need for last-minute fuss; this can be made up to three days ahead.
5010919~Green Harissa~1264~60~14~5~113~3821~10~Harissa is typically made with hot chiles and served with couscous. This herb-based spin is great with roasted vegetables, or as a rub for fish.

5010923~Vegetable and Feta Baked Frittata~752~28~5~53~53~2579~146~It's foolproof to make—just add everything and bake—but you'll look like a rock star when you serve it. -Scott
5010924~Lemongrass Pork Patties With Vietnamese Dipping Sauce~1505~76~35~82~91~4527~245~In Vietnam, little pork patties like this are often grilled over charcoal right on the street and diners sit and eat on (now iconic) little plastic stools. You can serve these patties simply wrapped in the lettuce leaves here, as a snack, or over vermicelli noodles, as a larger meal. Whats non-negotiable? Serve with plenty of herbs and the funky, salty, sour, sweet dipping sauce.
5010925~Herbed Goat Cheese, Roasted Beet, and Watercress Salad~689~145~18~17~0~2582~0~Highly recommended!
5010926~Pears Poached in Red Wine, Cardamom and Orange~5065~938~853~59~121~2039~491~A cardamom- and orange-scented syrup is spooned over warm pears and scoops of vanilla ice cream in this lovely dessert. Refrigerate leftover poaching syrup to serve over ice cream later in the week.

5010930~Country Ham Cheesecake~3621~25~8~279~290~9110~1301~This savory cheesecake from noted chef Marcel Desaulniers of The Trellis restaurant makes a standout first course for a large dinner party.
5015198~Fast Favorite Garlic Dill Pickles~167~64~0~0~0~11632~0~Often called kosher-style dill pickles, these are quick to make. Use either small whole cucumbers or cut larger ones into quarters. For an additional interesting flavor, tuck a small dried hot red pepper into each jar.
5010932~Shrimp and Scallop Curry~3333~330~3~241~100~2784~1806~Highly recommended!
5010935~South African Curried Lamb Meatloaf~1272~77~52~37~87~4973~506~Bobotie
5010936~Chile Jam Chicken With Caramelized Sweet Potatoes and Peaches~1261~161~90~25~56~4017~89~This is not your average chicken dinner. Chile jam adds spice and sweetness, and the accompaniments of caramelized sweet potatoes and peaches take it out of this world. Let the chicken thighs continue to crisp in a cast-iron pan as the jam glaze reduces around them, and it will naturally create a crisp sticky-crunchy coating that is to die for!
5010937~Orange Roughy with Arugula, Garlic and Tomatoes~526~204~69~69~0~875~0~Cooking the fish en papillote, in parchment paper or foil, keeps it moist.
5010938~Duck Breasts with Coriander, Endive, and Sweet-and-Sour Orange Sauce~1672~310~284~27~38~660~161~(Suprêmes de Canette à la Coriandre, Endive Braisée, Sauce Aigre-Douce à l'Orange)
5010939~Chicken, Rice, and Mango in Lettuce Wraps~3148~291~45~48~191~7056~166~You'll have some leftover creamy ginger soy dressing for salad later in the week.

5010943~Green Poblano Rice (Arroz Verde al Poblano)~1324~245~5~22~24~405~28~There are many versions of special-occasion green rice in Mexico. My current favorite is this one, green with the richness and welcoming spiciness of poblano chiles, backed up by herbal cilantro and sweet onion and garlic. This full-flavored rice can accompany a simple grilled fish or chicken or any dish that weaves a little green chile into its sauce.
5010944~Minted Lamb Burgers~2444~267~199~134~98~5248~463~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5010945~Sausage Links with Apricot-Mustard Glaze~1722~89~53~82~118~3205~378~"A sweet-and-hot glaze dresses up purchased breakfast links. If you prefer extra spice, use the sausages labeled ""hot and sweet links."""
5010947~Asian Shrimp, Pineapple, and Peanut Salad~1259~162~117~30~57~4276~194~Pineapple helps give this Asian salad a perfect balance of hot, salty, tangy, and sweet.
5010948~Apple Cheese Quick Bread~2839~266~40~147~197~2556~689~Highly recommended!
5010949~Hold-The-Lime Guacamole~224~15~2~3~16~1269~0~Lime is an integral part of great guacamole—or so we thought. Turns out, you get to taste and enjoy the pure flavor of avocado better in guacamole without the lime.
5010951~Individual Pear and Maple Cobblers~4356~585~257~49~177~1468~616~Maple syrup is one of New England's unique gifts to the culinary world. The natural sweetener is a wonderful complement to all kinds of ingredients but is especially good when teamed with pears, which are plentiful in fall. Here they're partnered in a cobbler, an old-fashioned dessert of fruit baked with a biscuit topping. Make sure to pass whipped cream flavored with the delicate syrup.
5010952~Sour Cream Bran Muffins~2143~293~156~61~113~2307~218~This is the Rolls-Royce of bran muffin recipes.

5010954~Curry-Dusted Scallops with Pea Purée~1058~35~5~113~45~1612~284~Golden-brown scallops are gorgeous when framed by a bright pea purée. An infusion of curry and lime juice invigorates this dish.
5010955~Dark Ginger Rye Cake With Yogurt and Honey~6197~1079~736~88~216~6626~431~Richly spiced gingerbread with the texture of a moist, dense devil’s food cake, this recipe only gets better if you make it ahead.
5010956~Pan-Grilled Paillards of Duck~1011~16~12~0~100~4025~107~Highly recommended!
5010957~Grilled Rib-Eye Steaks with Black Bean Sauce~1151~34~7~4~89~962~345~Indigo's chef and owner is Glenn Chu, who was born in Hawaii and learned to cook from his Chinese grandmother — and by watching Julia Child on television. The result: Eurasian cuisine, which Chu showcases in selections as eclectic as goat cheese wontons with four-fruit sauce, and grilled shrimp with Thai macadamia-nut pesto. The romantic dining room has a tropical-island motif, with ceiling fans, bamboo, and bird-of-paradise.
5010958~Maple-Oatmeal Sandwich Bread~4928~870~76~159~69~2140~67~A hint of sweetness makes this perfect for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. It's great toasted, too.
5010959~Sautéed Fennel with Almonds, Raisins, and Saffron~1297~116~60~14~87~198~0~Carena brings an almost Moroccan sensibility to this delicious play of sweet and savory, from the crisp-tender fennel to the orange essences and underlying traces of saffron and raisins.
5010961~Moroccan Chicken with Preserved Meyer Lemons and Green Olives~1143~51~11~19~57~2236~45~This recipe is just one of the countless ways to use preserved lemons.
5010962~Shredded Sweet Potato and Carrot Fritters (Ukoy)~18148~360~20~27~1918~1333~217~Frying ukoy the Bad Saint way is a very active process­—the fritter will blow apart in the oil before you tease it back together. Use a tall pot with plenty of extra room since the oil will bubble vigorously when the mix hits it.
5010963~Mango-Curry Shrimp Salad in Wonton Cups~1350~68~4~81~87~2338~777~Green curry paste (a blend of green chilies, garlic, onion, and spices) adds explosive flavor to these one-biters. You'll need a miniature muffin tin to prepare the wonton cups.
5010964~Cornmeal Biscuits with Cheddar and Chipotle~4035~400~65~164~137~6055~414~Highly recommended!
5010965~Baked Camembert with Hazelnut Crust~595~68~3~21~23~283~4~Highly recommended!
5010966~Michael Romano's Secret-Ingredient Soup~3105~168~56~188~217~18295~733~The secret ingredient in this satisfying soup is a small amount of cornmeal (polenta), just enough to thicken the broth slightly. It balances the substantial sausage and greens for a soothing cold-weather dish.
5010967~Coconut Chicken Curry With Turmeric and Lemongrass~701~74~26~16~32~2007~62~This isn’t a super-saucy curry; the aromatics will brown and fry in the pan, yielding lots of yummy crisp bits. Serve with steamed rice.
5010968~Hearts of Palm and Artichoke Aguachile Negro~971~93~36~9~56~992~0~Aguachile is a chile and citrus dressing that's often paired with raw fish. You'll want to drink Bukantz's veggie version right from the platter.
5010969~Fish with Curried Cucumber Tomato Water and Tomato Herb Salad~790~8~5~21~72~2268~36~Highly recommended!
5010970~Vegetable Couscous, Goat Cheese, and Beets~1993~210~42~68~95~4070~141~Active time: 30 min Start to finish: 30 min
5010972~Mussels in Green Peppercorn Sauce~2318~13~6~256~112~6044~1073~Green peppercorns (left over from Chicken Spice Rub ) subtly transform the classic combination of mussels steamed with butter, shallots, and wine by adding a bright, floral fragrance. Pluck the mussels from the pot as they open and then enrich the cooking liquid with cream.
5010973~Roast Chicken with Pesto and Potatoes~4476~726~137~100~116~24071~109~Highly recommended!

5010977~Jerusalem Artichoke and Artichoke Heart Linguine~1261~103~64~0~96~6705~0~Despite their names and their common family, the Jerusalem artichoke and the globe artichoke aren't at all alike—one is a tuber, the other a thistle. Yet, flavorwise, they relate perfectly in this pasta dish. Add some slivers of red onion, lots of garlic, a kick of red pepper flakes, a squeeze of lemon juice, and a shower of thinly sliced fresh mint and you have a boldly seasoned pasta dish worthy of serving to company yet easy enough for a family meal.
5010978~Potted Shrimp~1424~27~15~51~117~847~766~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5016720~Chicken Legs with Achiote Garlic Sauce~773~115~54~21~29~3409~62~This dish, flavored with achiote seeds, garlic, and spices, is based on chicken pibil, from Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. Traditionally, the chicken is baked in banana leaves, but here we've used collard leaves because they are more readily available. They add moisture and a bit of flavor but do not get tender enough to eat.
5010980~Iced Horchata Latte~1446~232~175~20~39~237~2~If you feel like experimenting, try using cashews or pecans in place of the almonds.
5010981~Bacon-Wrapped Corn on the Cob~686~13~6~32~54~1666~115~We have found that bacon gives the corn a nice smoky flavor, but it doesn't get brown and crispy. You can either eat it with the corn or peel it off.
5010982~Citrus Shrimp, Rice, and Black Bean Salad~1308~190~31~105~12~2795~660~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5010990~Spicy Black Beans with Chorizo and Chipotle Cream~1183~97~8~39~69~1539~64~The beans need to soak overnight, so be sure to start this recipe one day ahead.
5010992~Make-Your-Own Salad with Lemon Garlic Dressing~1904~61~18~31~171~7672~67~Highly recommended!
5010993~Red Pepper Hummus~189~39~4~0~0~281~0~Teamed with pita bread triangles and a variety of raw vegetables, this Middle Eastern dip makes a great snack or hors d'oeuvre for a dinner party. Tahini is available at natural foods stores and some supermarkets.
5010994~Pear-Ginger Strudel with Ginger-Custard Sauce~5690~603~483~22~345~777~978~Purchased phyllo makes this pear strudel quick and easy to prepare.

5010996~Fennel and Orange Salad with Lemon-Ginger Vinaigrette~751~81~15~12~42~738~0~"Typically steamed or sautéed, fresh mustard greens are also great raw and simply dressed. ""I like the strength they give to salads,"" says de Pue."

5011000~Lord Grey's Peach Preserves~5650~1492~1444~15~0~159~0~Earl Grey tea gives these easy preserves a subtle floral note.

5011005~Cornmeal Crepes with Ricotta and Ham~2851~442~126~132~91~5719~633~Hot pepper jelly is an unexpected taste that picks up the sweetness of the corn and cornmeal.

5011009~Cinnamon-Sugar Plum Cake~2332~293~48~43~102~1157~623~"""I'm a social worker running my own practice,"" writes Susan Haskell of Boston, Massachusetts. ""In addition, I'm getting a doctorate in social work. So most of my time is spent either working with patients or writing my dissertation. Still, no matter what's on my schedule, nothing can stop me from going into the kitchen. During the week, I make the time to pore over food magazines to find recipes I want to try. On Saturdays, I cook for friends — because next to cooking, sharing the results is my favorite thing to do."""

5011024~Scallops Verde~3927~40~6~116~369~3021~817~Highly recommended!
5011025~Rack of Lamb with Garlic and Herbs~433~17~0~3~38~4323~0~Herb-and-bread-crumb coatings are classic on rack of lamb, but leaving out the crumbs lightens the dish (and the juicy chops taste more summery as a result). This recipe is best made with new garlic — garlic that has not been aged. It is covered with a moist membrane rather than papery skin and is often sold with greens attached. If you're lucky enough to find some, substitute 1/4 cup chopped garlic greens for half of the parsley in the herb mixture.
5011026~Rosemary, Lemon, and Garlic Leg of Lamb with Roasted Potatoes~1272~241~11~23~27~969~0~Highly recommended!
5011027~Stir-Fried Cabbage~267~6~3~3~29~0~0~"""My wife, Jean, and I run a coffee farm on the Big Island of Hawaii,"" writes George Fike of Keauhou Mauka, Hawaii. ""I really love to cook, so we entertain a lot, and I enjoy planning the dinners as much as I do making them. I tell people the best restaurant in town is our house! Since I do most of the cooking, recipes must either be relatively fast or look after themselves."""
5011028~Cardamom Pound Cake~3760~451~247~117~228~2542~925~Part of what gives this cake its light texture is beating the butter and sugar well, so don't rush this step.
5011029~Steamed Mussels in Thai Curry Sauce~1477~18~15~193~62~6644~640~"""On a trip to the Northwest, I enjoyed dinner at Yarrow Bay Grill in Kirkland, Washington,"" writes Sue Eltringham of Prescott, Arizona.

5011032~Halvah Mille-Feuilles~955~99~21~21~47~544~0~Though this recipe calls for a raspberry garnish, feel free to swap in caramelized apples or toasted pistachios. When working with phyllo dough, make sure to keep the unused phyllo sheets covered as much as possible, as they tend to dry out quickly.
5011033~Gratineed Mustard Creamed Onions~1477~167~57~60~63~1675~196~A hit of coarse-grain mustard and a topping of toasted parmesan crumbs transform creamed onions from a sleepy staple into an exciting side that can hold its own.

I think this is pretty close to perfect, and the flavors marry well with the Elvis-inspired peanut butter layer.

5011122~Purslane and Avocado Tacos with Pico de Gallo~1196~113~20~32~69~3456~118~Purslane has long been considered a weed, but it is increasingly showing up for sale in bunches at farmers markets. Meanwhile, Mexicans have known about its healthful properties for hundreds of years and they eat it both raw and cooked. In Mexico it's called verdolagas. Cooking mellows its tang and shrinks it, which means you can eat more of it! Paired with avocado and a tomato relish, this is a super-healthy vegetarian snack or main dish.
5011123~Quinoa-Batter Fish Fry~1304~239~0~33~16~10901~0~Missing those fried fish tacos you had that one time at a shabby little beach restaurant in Southern California? Or the fish-and-chips from the chipper? Yeah, me too. The nice thing about this recipe is you can fry up a batch easily—no deep-fat fryer required. The batter is made with quinoa flour and gets added texture and crispness from toasted quinoa. Serve the fish as a main dish with whatever side you life, douse it in malt vinegar, or satisfy that California craving and use it to make tacos.

5011130~Fried Chicken Sandwich with Slaw and Spicy Mayo~3621~435~135~152~123~6764~238~If your idea of coleslaw is the pleated paper cup of shredded stuff alongside BLTs at the diner, it's time for a new rule: Slaw doesn't go with the sandwich, it goes on the sandwich. Slaws deliver on several fronts. They're crunchy, and sandwiches need crunch. Done right, slaws give a bright acidic kick to counter the fatty goodness of meats and mayo. And they provide a temperature contrast to warm sandwiches, like this fried-chicken masterpiece from Son of a Gun in Los Angeles. We can't think of a sandwich that doesn't deserve slaw, so pile it on.
5011131~Stir-Fried Black Rice with Fried Egg and Roasted Broccoli~2077~357~0~54~54~140~370~This is the kind of healthy, satisfying food that we all wish would simply materialize at home for dinner. But making it in parts is easier than you might think!

5011135~Fruit Salad with Herb, Citrus, Mint-Maple, or Basic Syrup~1330~310~219~7~0~147~0~"When I was growing up, my mom would cut up fresh fruit and arrange it on a plate with a shot glass full of toothpicks. She would also toss fresh fruit with some orange or lime juice and sugar. Taking inspiration from her, I came up with my own version: lime, lemon, a little maple syrup, and an herb syrup with rosemary or mint.
Cut your fruit into chunks rather than into small pieces; I find that small pieces of fruit get mealy and mushy. Make the salad the morning you're going to serve it, but if you're determined to make it the night before, cut up the fruit, store it in separate containers, and then toss it together in the morning. Use whatever fruit you'd like (bananas, apples, berries—the possibilities are endless), but unless you're using the ripest, sweetest seasonal fruit, add a little sugar."

5011173~Walnut Cake~16900~635~350~395~1562~2218~1126~"Nadine Levy Redzepi created this incredibly rich, moist cake. ""Fat with fat—what could be better?"" asks her husband. Serve it for dessert or with coffee or tea for breakfast."

Diamondidis of Germantown, Maryland. ""A few years ago, I created this delicious, hearty soup as a new way to enjoy turkey."""
5011312~Brown Turkey Stock~306~71~50~318~122~1920~885~A spectacular gravy begins with pan drippings, but the true flavor base comes from a good stock. The real selling point of this stock is that you can make it way in advance of Thanksgiving. And any leftovers of the stock will enhance the soups and sauces that follow the big feast.
5011180~Berry-Yogurt Smoothie~490~95~79~8~7~240~28~This luscious, low-fat drink couldn't be easier to make. It has a thick, creamy texture produced by pureeing the frozen berries. No ice cubes necessary.
5011181~Jalebi~5870~281~7~37~506~3448~990~Jalebis are small, bright yellow, web-shaped cakes similar to funnel cakes. They are popular celebration and street cakes in Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and India. Soaking them in saffron syrup and then drying them gives the cakes a crispy outer shell. They are made with maida flour (a finely milled wheat flour) and Bengal gram flour (a flour milled from chickpeas), both of which can be found at Indian groceries. If you can't find them, use cake or pastry flour. If you can find fresh yeast, use it instead of the dry yeast; that is the traditional method and it adds to the flavor.

5011184~Ivory Carrot Soup with a Fine Dice of Orange Carrots~959~94~12~24~55~2704~99~What happens if you make a carrot soup with just white carrots? Will people get the carrot taste if the soup isn't orange? Although the carrot flavor is full there, garnishing the soup with carrot greens and finely diced orange and yellow carrots locks the flavor in more firmly. This is an extremely simple soup, intentionally so to underscore the purity of color and flavor. Try making it with pale yellow carrots, too.

5011192~Hearty Lamb and Vegetable Stew~3169~300~203~155~154~8106~551~"Shullie Neumark of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, writes: ""I like cooking but I'm a little bit impatient, which is why I make dishes that can be done ahead of time — and quickly. I hate being rushed before meals, especially when guests are on their way over. Those guests are usually good friends or members of our large family. My husband and I emigrated from South Africa seven years ago. I am retired from preschool teaching, but I still keep busy by cooking for the family. A typical South African dinner is a barbecue with lots of grilled lamb chops and sausages."""
5011193~Cucumbers in Yogurt~540~64~31~20~18~3239~61~Greek yogurt, if you can find it, is incredibly thick and creamy and a delight to eat. It shows up in several guises on the Greek table — as a savory dip, in sauces, or for dessert.
5011194~Beef and Green Pepper Stir-Fry~1435~64~6~47~106~6791~106~Highly recommended!
5011195~Charred Romaine Greek Salad With Quinoa-Crusted Feta~2026~68~8~61~174~4339~180~"I live in New York, where Greek salads are a reliable diner staple. I love the combination of briny Kalamata olives and salty feta cheese mixed with crisp romaine lettuce and refreshing cucumbers. This somewhat deconstructed, twenty-first century version applies the ""warm goat cheese salad"" method to a Greek salad, coating fresh feta slices in egg wash and quinoa and then pan-frying. The result is incredibly delicious—and as good as it looks in the picture!"

5011199~Pork, Vegetable, and Tamarind Stew~1862~267~14~29~72~6398~0~The finished stew should be decidedly sour, tamarind’s calling card, but you’re in control of how ­puckery things get. You can sub other vegetables or simplify the array, but be very careful not to overcook them. This recipe is from Bad Saint, one of Bon Appétit's Hot 10, America's Best New Restaurants 2016.
5011200~Irish Weekend Fry-Up~562~85~14~34~22~981~401~"A fry-up is great when friends are staying over—simply multiply the ingredients given below by however many people you are feeding. Source the best local ingredients you can and follow up with a big walk. You can have your eggs boiled or poached, if you prefer.
Our family eats an Irish breakfast or some parts of it at least once a week, and not always in the morning. We're lucky to have great producers of bacon and, of course, black and white pudding, which is a particular specialty of Cork County. Black pudding (blood sausage) may be more popular worldwide, but white pudding is very popular in Ireland and an important part of an Irish breakfast. White pudding is similar to black pudding, but it contains no blood—only pork, spices, and usually oatmeal. I love this big cooked breakfast, but it isn't something I'll eat early in the morning before I go for a run!"

5011349~Licorice Pudding~1190~125~115~44~52~1743~178~Scandinavians simply adore black licorice; the selection available in their grocery stores rivals that of chocolate bars in ours. But you don't have to be crazy about it to enjoy this pudding, which is wonderfully smooth and tantalizingly tinged with molasses and anise. We found that Panda brand black licorice works best in this particular recipe.
5011222~Milk-Braised Pork~688~55~51~15~44~473~56~In this simple recipe, an adaptation of Italian cooking legend Marcella Hazan's Bolognese-style pork loin braised in milk, the meat acquires a delicate texture and flavor and the milk slowly evolves into a rich sauce of golden curds. Don't be put off by its homely appearance!
5011223~Foster's Omelets~298~0~0~12~27~140~417~An omelet can be as delicious plain as filled with an almost endless array of cooked vegetables, cheeses, herbs, smoked meats, fish, and more. Look in your refrigerator and utilize leftovers such as grilled asparagus, cooked broccoli, or spinach. I always garnish the omelet with a sauce, salsa, or herb that complements the filling.

This adorable five-inch layer cake was inspired by the romantic tradition—and can be enjoyed right now.

5011243~French Apple-Almond Tart~4998~355~80~116~345~2207~847~Early French gardeners developed the espalier method of growing fruit trees-the trees are trained to grow flat against a wall or trellis-so they could take full advantage of the sun and use small plots of land efficiently. October finds markets full of newly harvested crisp apples that add wonderful flavor to this traditional French tart.
5011244~Roasted Chicken with Za'atar Stuffing~1123~200~0~31~19~2503~0~A good roast chicken is one of my favorite things to cook and eat. Every cook should know how to roast a chicken properly.

5012675~Cashew Orange Biscotti~3692~546~274~162~174~2692~371~These biscotti are equally delicious made with roasted almonds, pecans, or hazelnuts in place of the cashews.
5011246~Pear Cobbler with Dried Blueberries and Stone-Ground Corn Biscuits~9728~2217~1102~93~25~4113~63~Apple juice and dried blueberries bring subtle sweetness to the filling. Like your desserts sweeter? Add one or two tablespoons of sugar.

5011259~Vegetarian Red Pozole with Red Beans~3809~458~243~52~199~8634~399~This vegetarian take on a traditional Mexican red pozole—pozole being the name not only of a type of stew, often made with pork, but also of the large dried corn kernels (hominy) integral to the mixture—is rich and satisfying. The accompaniments are an essential and fun part of the dish, adding some fresh crunch to the toothsome bite of hominy, beans, and vegetables. It's the perfect meal to have waiting on the back of the stove for family and friends as they straggle in from near and far for a holiday weekend.
5011260~Brook Trout Müllerin~794~30~3~10~76~1180~126~"Trout cooked this way is called müllerin, ""the miller's wife's"" fish, because it's made from filets of mountain trout fished from the stream that powers the flour mill. It is precisely the same preparation and derivation as the French meunière. Don't be fooled by its apparent simplicity: layers of flavor are built by each ingredient in its turn—it is elegant in its simplicity. The trout filets are lightly coated with flour, browned in a pan with good butter, and by the time the fish is cooked, the butter has turned nutty brown and the fish is crisp and tender. Just before serving, a squeeze of lemon and freshly chopped parsley turn the butter in the pan into bubbly foam which is then spooned over each filet."
5011261~Italian Sausage Pasta Salad~3027~189~62~208~163~9628~280~Accompany this robust salad with crusty bread and serve grapes for dessert.
5011263~Orange-Almond Lace Cookies~4249~253~195~90~333~2257~383~The egg makes these a little less delicate (and less likely to break) than traditional lace cookies. Arrange them in a decorative box or tin lined with festive tissue paper, then secure the package with a fancy bow.
5011264~Duck Confit Hash~1331~93~25~22~99~5745~311~Hash has never been so decadent. Pieces of duck confit, tender vegetables, and golden-brown potatoes meld with a lavish drizzle of heavy cream and Madeira to create a breakfast centerpiece.

5011266~Mango and Coconut Rice Salad~2655~177~99~42~204~5306~214~Everybody knows now that the undisputed king of mangoes is the Indian Alphonso. It is intensely sweet and has an unbeatable perfumed aroma. I'd go as far as saying that you haven't tasted a real mango until you've tried an Alphonso (and nobody is paying me for this). The season, though, is very short—mid-April to the end of May—so try to prepare this salad then.

5011281~Roasted Chicken Wings with Smoked-Paprika Mayonnaise~3825~169~51~262~256~21964~1001~These chicken wings need to marinate for at least 8 hours — we recommend putting them in the refrigerator before you go to bed so they'll be ready for roasting the next day.

5011301~Semolina–Lemon Syrup Cakes~4043~171~38~96~341~1593~749~Beating the butter and sugar properly (read thoroughly) gives these mini cakes lift, but they will still be moist and marzipan-y in the center.
5011302~Pork Tenderloin with Apricot Mustard~2136~467~238~40~17~3622~58~Make the most of apricot season while it lasts. Matching the fruit with mustard and pork is one of the best ways to enjoy it.

5011306~Chocolate-Raspberry Soufflé~2179~304~234~32~96~1741~198~Don't be scared of soufflé! Make the base super flavorful and moist by stirring in a jam or jelly, then help it rise with a properly whipped French meringue. Whip the eggs until just medium firm so they have more room to expand in the oven and help the soufflé rise.

5017409~Agave-Glazed Turkey Breast with Sherry Gravy~655~82~68~21~29~4508~54~Agave nectar, a product of the agave plant better known as the source of tequila, blends beautifully with Old World Spanish sherry for a gentle sweet-and-sour glaze and luscious gravy. Because agave nectar has a low glycemic index, it's the new darling of the health-conscious crowd who are trying to lower their sugar intake. Although making the brown turkey stock for the gravy is an extra step, it can be done weeks ahead and frozen, and it's the secret behind a truly memorable gravy.
5017151~Citrus-Infused Custard Sauce~1444~33~28~19~141~1254~712~Highly recommended!

5011324~Smoked Salmon Toasts with Malt Vinegar Syrup~1117~133~108~21~55~683~221~The Irish are famous for their smoked salmon, so it's a natural for a St. Patrick's Day party. Of course, you don't have to use Irish smoked salmon for these toasts; any coldsmoked salmon will work well, but if you're feeling flush, you will be treating yourself to salmon that is supersilky in texture with a distinct smokiness that comes from spending time near smoldering hardwoods such as oak and beechwood. If topping your salmon with anything other than a gentle squeeze of lemon seems like heresy, don't knock our tangysweet malt vinegar syrup until you've tried it. You just might get hooked.
5011325~Turkey Sausage-Spinach Lasagna with Spicy Tomato Sauce~5394~49~33~441~377~16683~1662~One great thing about this lasagna is that the noodles don't need to be pre-boiled. The dish has a lot of liquid (in the form of sauce) and goes into the oven covered, so the noodles get cooked perfectly as the lasagna bakes. Add a green salad, and serve some Chianti or California red Zinfandel with the main course.
5011326~Bulgur and Black-Eyed Pea Salad with Tomatoes, Onions, and Pomegranate Dressing~4352~515~30~105~226~4938~0~Turkish cooking might sound exotic, but it's easy. Most of the ingredients are familiar, and combining them in new ways makes for an exciting and different way to eat. This is an excellent side salad for lamb chops. For a great small-plates dinner party menu that's modern Turkish cooking at its best, pick up the May issue of Bon Appétit.
5013830~Espagnole Sauce~1364~135~55~25~81~2984~214~"Espagnole is a classic brown sauce, typically made from brown stock, mirepoix, and tomatoes, and thickened with roux. Given that the sauce is French in origin, where did the name come from? According to Alan Davidson, in The Oxford Companion to Food, ""The name has nothing to do with Spain, any more than the counterpart term allemande has anything to do with Germany. It is generally believed that the terms were chosen because in French eyes Germans are blond and Spaniards are brown."""
5011329~Rum Raisin Shortbread~4007~589~405~78~205~1950~506~This crumbly shortbread is studded with dried currants, which are tiny raisins made from Zante grapes. The currants must be soaked overnight, so you'll need to plan your craving a day in advance.
5011330~Biddy's Flapjacks~4104~494~110~86~199~483~253~"In the 1600s, ""flapjack"" referred to a thick pancake that was cooked on a skillet and turned by being tossed (flapped). By the 1930s, it had come to mean a biscuit like this, made from rolled oats, syrup and butter--sort of the granola bars of their day. They're the perfect thing to have with a cup of tea or coffee."
5012631~Raspberry Fool~4073~19~3~26~399~361~1337~Offer butter cookies alongside this pretty pink dessert.

5011342~Crispy Roast Duck with Blackberry Sauce~835~152~130~18~16~1666~110~While entertaining guests, the Earl of Grantham might perhaps offer a bit of hunting—should the weather permit. Although fowl such as pheasants or wild game like hare might be preferred, should a guest kill a mallard or some other duck, it would not go to waste. Mrs. Patmore could certainly use the duck in a fine recipe such as this one to offer the guests a taste of their own hunting prowess.
5020015~Crostini~516~60~2~10~27~660~0~These little toasts make a crisp base for savory toppings of eggplant and roasted peppers , chickpeas and mint , and sweet-and-sour onions . Mix and match as you please — if you prefer one topping over another, the recipes can easily be doubled.
5011345~Tuscan Turkey Soupy Noodles~866~76~19~5~58~1215~0~Turkey soup may be the end of the line for turkey leftovers, but it doesn't have to be boring and predictable.

5011348~Braised Turnip Greens with Turnips and Apples~790~126~64~21~26~3459~63~Spicy, sharp turnip greens, braised gently with a smoked ham hock, are a time-honored accompaniment on southern tables at any time of the year. Add in the turnips, plus lots of apple, and the dish tastes lighter and more delicate. It's also very pretty, with the ivory turnips, golden apple, and pink ham nestled among the dark greens.
5017656~Chicken and Vegetable Sauté Over Herbed Polenta Triangles~2010~145~61~102~113~7948~267~You can prepare the polenta a day ahead. The chicken and vegetables can be made earlier in the day, and both can be reheated before serving. Team this with a radicchio and arugula salad, and uncork a Pinot Grigio.
5011352~Summer Rolls with Baked Tofu and Sweet-and-Savory Dipping Sauce~816~105~10~34~25~723~0~Vietnamese-style rolls are a great addition to your summer repertoire: They require very little cooking and can be assembled at the kitchen table or out on the patio. Thanks to bean thread noodles and baked tofu, they make a substantial meal, but pickled vegetables and a trio of herbs keep each sauce-dipped bite light and cool.
5011353~Apple Noodle Kugel~2199~314~193~32~95~229~736~Noodle kugels, or baked puddings, abound in Ashkenazic Jewish cookery, and this particular version makes an outstanding dessert or brunch dish. You'll find that the mild sweetness of coarsely grated Gala apples perks up the hearty richness.
5011354~Scrambled Eggs with Sausage and Thyme~892~29~11~41~78~2898~572~Reduced-fat cream cheese gives this dish a nice texture. Put out some sliced melon with grapes, and offer coffee and orange juice.

5011362~Soba Salad with Miso Dressing~3501~238~42~68~253~7962~14~White miso might sound like the kind of ingredient that sends you in search of a specialty store, but in fact it is the most common type of miso paste, and you're likely to find it in the international or Asian food section of the supermarket. It's a lighter, sweeter alternative to dark miso, which is generally used in soup, and it often appears in dressings like the one for this easy Japanese noodle salad.

5011387~Chinese Beef Noodle Soup~1064~201~35~253~131~1230~998~In classic Chinese cooking, noodles destined for soup are cooked separately and added at the last minute so that the starch from the pasta doesn't cloud the broth. Because we were aiming for a rib-sticking dish, we broke with tradition and cooked the noodles right in the stock, allowing the starch to thicken the soup slightly.

5011428~Lemony Green Beans and Peas~261~22~12~7~12~506~31~The play of shapes and shades of green in this vegetable combo takes the humdrum out of these supermarket standbys. Lemon zest adds just the right zip of citrus, but unlike a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, it won't turn the greens an unappealing khaki shade.
5011429~Dilled Tuna-Cucumber Salad~513~18~10~27~40~1467~76~Serve on a bed of lettuce with dill sprigs and sliced ripe tomatoes or pile onto whole wheat bread with crisp lettuce for a satisfying sandwich.

5011444~Sweet Potato and Brussels Sprout Okonomiyaki~1520~89~15~46~117~2883~75~For this nontraditional okonomiyaki recipe, you need to julienne the potato.

5014682~Tiramisu Yule Log~5129~404~297~62~392~1669~1326~We get a little weak-kneed with delight around cakes, particularly cakes whimsically shaped to look like something else—in this case, a Yule log. Made famous in France as Bûches de Noël, these sheet cakes, filled, rolled, and frosted to look like the trunks of trees, complete with the stumps of sawed off branches, provide creative cooks the very real opportunity to play with their food. Want a few woodsy meringue mushrooms made from meringue to continue the conceit? Why not?
5011448~Peel-and-Eat Hot Pepper Shrimp~593~39~3~99~5~12648~880~In Jamaica, this dish turns up by the seaside or near rivers, as janga (river crayfish) are often used. It is seriously, deliciously hot — wash the heat down with ice-cold beer.

It's a great dish to make any day of the year, and perfect for a Super Bowl gathering or any party.

5011451~Asian Turkey-Noodle Soup with Ginger and Chiles~919~175~15~30~7~4185~70~Highly recommended!
5012107~Quick and Rich Turkey Stock~227~21~13~3~15~3215~31~No matter how fast you prepare Thanksgiving dinner, you must have gravy, and you must have stuffing. And both need homemade turkey stock. This one is fast, even with the time it takes to brown the giblets, neck, and wing tips. You can mostly ignore it while it simmers, but you wont be able to deny its enriching, ennobling presence in your finished gravy and stuffing.

5011461~Beer Americano~143~33~31~2~1~912~0~When the Italian fashion brand Trussardi opened their sprawling flagship store across from La Scala, Milan’s historic opera house, they strategically included a ground-floor café to revitalize weary shoppers. As any serious fashionista knows, nothing helps one pull the trigger when wavering over a new handbag or pair of cufflinks like a little liquid encouragement. At Trussardi Café, bartender Tommaso Cecca has not only transformed the brand’s fragrances into aromatic cocktails, but made his own twists on Italian classics, such as the Americano. Replacing soda water with a beer float makes for a frothy, refreshing cocktail. For a lighter, more floral version of this cocktail, Cecca uses dry white vermouth, Weizen or wheat beer, and a lemon peel as garnish. To achieve Trussardi-worthy froth at home, try using an Aerolatte, a mini whisk-blender more commonly used to prepare milk foam for a cappuccino.

The Sanskrit word for mango is amra, meaning ""of the people."" I think barbecue means ""of the people"" in America so I have united them here. Justin and I demonstrate this dish at mango festivals from time to time. The bonus: We always bring a bowl of it premade so that the guests can have a taste. That means the batch we make up on stage comes home. You'll be left with half of the BBQ sauce from this recipe, but you'll be pleased as you can use it on any kind of thing in the world that you might barbecue. It is outrageously good on a burger."

They're so moist, sticky, cinnamon-y, and delicious you'll never miss those sugar-laden ones sold at malls. P.S. These smell even better than ""those"" when they're baking...and they don't have a million calories. Make them vegan by using butter and milk substitutes."

Don't be put off by the long list of ingredients — we promise you won't be disappointed if you make the sauce from scratch. (It's so much fresher and more complex than any bottled product you may have used in the past.) The meat can be marinated and the sauce prepared ahead, so you just need to grill the satés before serving.
5011655~Scallops with Spice Oil~2211~68~2~15~202~6082~31~Blooming spices, or gently frying them in oil, is a quick way to deepen their flavor.

5011664~My Green Papaya Salad~3979~680~541~74~117~5174~95~Every Southeast asian country has some variation of green papaya or mango salad. Since it doesn't taste like much (nice texture, though), it's all about the supporting cast as far as delivering flavor goes. And in this version there's such a big cast that you can lose one or two items and the salad will still taste real good. You can even lose the papaya (shhhh) and make it with all the other goodies. Just don't lose the fish sauce, palm sugar, lime juice, or chili—deal?

5011670~Blackberry-Poblano Margarita~24~4~1~0~0~283~0~The luscious purple color of this drink is a stunner! Taste a berry first to check for sweetness. If it's not supersweet, add a tablespoon of sugar when muddling the berries.

5011703~Grilled Chicken with Root Beer Barbecue Sauce~55~25~14~0~0~6407~0~Every trick in the barbecue kit is used to create this incredible dish: a spice rub for deep-down flavor, a mop to keep the chicken moist during cooking, wood chips for old-fashioned smoke taste, and, of course, a delicious sauce that features root beer. Using root beer is a great idea since it is sweet and aromatic—qualities you expect in barbecue sauce. Ask your butcher to halve the chickens and remove the backbones.
5011704~Cucumber-Aloe Cocktail~172~82~42~40~0~24180~0~"""Here's a summer cocktail that isn't too herbaceous or vegetably,"" Kinch says. ""Aloe juice goes well with cucumbers, and Hendrick's Gin adds nice rose and cucumber notes."""

5011707~Veal Bocconcini with Porcini and Rosemary~1341~39~15~17~115~3516~198~"Though you may associate bocconcini with the tiny mozzarella balls sold at Italian markets and cheese shops, the word simply means ""little bites"" (the veal in this stew is cut into bite-size pieces). When purchasing dried porcini, look for packages containing large, flat, recognizable slices of the mushroom."

It's part of a special menu he created for Epicurious's Wine.Dine.Donate program. If lamb is not brought to room temperature before being placed in oven, roasting may take up to 45 minutes.
5011721~Melissa Hotek's Granola~8307~989~248~243~380~5846~0~Honey and dried fruit sweeten oats and nuts to make this easy stir-and-bake breakfast.

5011723~Almond, Chocolate, and Pistachio Spumoni~4029~665~455~102~125~1614~174~Spumoni trumps all others as the ideal frozen treat: It's richer than gelato, lighter than ice cream, and smoother than frozen custard. The inspiration for this classic flavor combination came from L & B Spumoni Gardens, in Brooklyn, a favorite spot for this tricolor treat.
5011724~Glazed Vegetables~268~12~9~1~23~41~63~Take a breather from roasting. Our stovetop method for this glazed vegetables recipe yields glossy, tender results and works on basically any firm veg.

Falafel is the most popular street food in Israel, but borekas run a close second. This sophisticated version of the dish makes a delicious appetizer.

5011736~Open-Face Grilled Chicken, Maytag Blue Cheese, and Toasted Pecan Sandwich~1014~72~16~18~70~1310~57~Maytag Blue cheese, made by the same family that became world famous for its appliances, is handmade from cow's milk and has a peppery, piquant flavor. Start this sandwich about an hour in advance so the chicken has time to marinate. This is an easy recipe to double or triple for a larger group, and the chicken can be made ahead. I like to serve this sandwich on raisin pumpernickel bread, but feel free to use another favorite loaf.
5011737~Scallops with Mushrooms in White-Wine Sauce~2106~117~44~38~144~749242~427~Coquilles St.-Jacques
5011739~Scotch Eggs with Fresh Herbs~1075~182~7~44~10~689~374~"Lindsay McDougal of Corona, California, writes: ""When my husband and I first moved to Southern California from a small town between Edinburgh and Glasgow, we were amazed by the variety of foods available. It's almost unfair to compare the two places, since there are so many different ethnic cuisines here. We've come to love Mexican and Italian cooking, but we still find ourselves yearning for the traditional Scottish recipes we grew up with, like Scotch eggs and meat and potato pies. They're hearty dishes and so easy to make."""
5011740~Open-Face Crab Burgers with Red Pepper Dressing~3088~387~37~139~125~7516~597~The burger's undeniable appeal and infinite flexibility have inspired culinary luminaries like Bobby Flay and Laurent Tourondel to devote entire restaurants to the humble sandwich. And despite what purists might say, some of todays best burgers aren't even made with beef. Patties made of lamb, bison, or seafood (like the crab burgers here) are increasingly popular. Toasted bread, a pita pocket, or even a lettuce leaf are fun standins for the traditional bun. In our homage to the modern burger, the crab patties are served open-face with a spicy red pepper dressing.

5011748~Chicken and Celery Pot Stickers~856~99~1~32~34~3667~66~Traditional pot stickers, complete with fresh dough and the requisite number of pleats, are best saved for a special occasion. This version, made with store–bought wonton wrappers, is easy enough for a weeknight meal. A flavorful filling of ground chicken and celery (left over from Sage Stuffing) is seasoned with sesame oil and soy sauce and enclosed within the simply folded wonton—no pleats involved. We do cook the pot stickers the conventional way, by first frying them and then steaming them until the water evaporates and the bottoms are crisp and golden. It is imperative to use dark chicken meat (from legs and thighs) because it doesn't dry out the way leaner white meat can.
5011749~Figs and Dried Cherries Poached in Vanilla-Honey Syrup with Pistachios~889~180~161~14~20~117~7~Highly recommended!
5011750~Peach, Prosciutto & Ricotta Crostini~540~64~18~37~11~2084~97~This is inspired by the Italian combination of fruit and ham (think melon and prosciutto) by way of Georgia.

5011754~Guava and Cream Cheese Pastry~1114~70~26~18~83~1003~172~This riff on a jalousie, a type of sweet whose top pastry lets you peek at the sweet filling within, features golden puff pastry filled with stripes of sweetened cream cheese and lush guava paste. Test kitchen director Ruth Cousineau conceived of this pastry as a dessert, but it would also make a decadent breakfast treat.
5011755~Blueberry Raspberry Pie~1241~289~185~9~8~78~0~When cleaning any fresh berries, place in a strainer, rinse very lightly with the sink spray hose, shake the strainer to drain water and gently pat dry with paper towels.

5011761~Goat Cheese Souffles in Phyllo Cups with Frisée Salad~2518~114~40~52~208~2243~739~You can make the soufflés 4 hours ahead (keep at room temperature). Put in a 375°F oven for 8 minutes to reheat.

5011786~Baby Greens with Artisinal Cheeses and Charcuterie~3201~174~110~91~235~3229~171~"Most chefs don't focus on salads. Maybe that's how ""chefs salad"" came to mean a pile of iceberg lettuce topped with bits of cheese, strips of cold cuts, and wedges of hard-boiled eggs. But with all the fantastic American cheeses and locally produced charcuterie available today, it's time to put the ""chef"" back in the chef's salad. It doesn't take long to arrange the meats and cheeses atop a bed of interesting greens, then whip up our quince dressing, drizzle—and dine."

5012426~Country Hash~1294~222~91~30~22~6392~370~Not everything Feniger serves at her restaurant is typical street food, and here's a delicious case in point. The intriguing combination of shredded brisket, diced root vegetables, and apples is based on a recipe that Feniger's grandmother Sylvia Morgan often made for family meals in Toledo, Ohio. Roasted poblano chiles, a nod to the chefs days at Santa Monica's Border Grill, add a spark of heat, and a fried egg makes it enormously satisfying.

5011797~Red Velvet Cupcakes with Mascarpone Cream Cheese Icing~12350~1479~935~237~590~5872~1854~Although legend has it that the red velvet cake originated in the early 1900s at New York City's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, it's been a Southern favorite for as long as I can remember. (A friend of mine recently reported seeing a version of it at a Starbucks in Mississippi.) Years ago, I made an armadillo-shaped red velvet cake for a wedding couple, complete with gray cream cheese icing for the animal's shell and scales. The idea may have come from the popular 1989 movie Steel Magnolias, which featured a red velvet armadillo groom's cake, a popular Southern tradition that continues to this day. The inspiration for my red velvet cupcakes came from my high-school boyfriend's grandmother. My mother was quite ill during those years, so I spent a lot of time with Bob Yarborough's family. His Birmingham, Alabama–born grandmother cooked and baked frequently, and I never forgot her red velvet cake. I wrote the instructions in my high-school recipe notebook and used it as a guide for developing these cupcakes. The mint extract and crushed mint candies add bit of holiday flair, but easily can be left out at other times of the year.

We have been known to ship these appetizers to friends and customers on the West Coast who have called in need of a fix. These seitan skewers are wonderful when well charred and served with refreshing Chimichurri Citrus-­Herb Sauce. They freeze very well and are great to have on hand to serve as appetizers, snacks, or an entrée.

The payoff: No pressure, no crust anxiety. Just loosely shape the dough for a rustic and beautiful Thanksgiving dessert."

With this one I had help. Our good friend Dr. Nersessian—a very good cook—came up with the first version of this to give me a dessert without the bad things. I have fiddled with it a bit.

5011966~Frozen Mint Chocolate Checkerboard~2770~170~116~52~228~1509~1278~We used an empty 1/2-gallon cardboard milk carton as a mold for this cake to keep the checkerboard pattern even.

5011975~Wild Rice and Chive Bâtardes~4645~899~20~160~17~4557~4~A bâtarde is a loaf of bread that is slightly thicker but shorter than a baguette. This version gets nice texture and flavor from cooked wild rice. Be sure to cook and cool the rice before making the bread.

5011977~Gingerbread Pancakes with Butterscotch Apples~1953~295~155~26~67~1430~67~If it makes sense sometimes to eat breakfast for dinner, why not breakfast for dessert? These pancakes are perfect for the fall, when apples are in season and gingerbread spices are on the mind. My apple of choice is the Golden Delicious because when cooked, it becomes honeyed and intense, but you can use any apple that holds its shape. Don't try this with McIntosh; they disintegrate into mush.

The combination of Parmesan and Gruyère cheeses adds richness to the dish. If you prefer, the eggs in the center can be replaced with more spinach. Simply sauté ten ounces of fresh spinach leaves in one tablespoon olive oil, then divide the spinach among the cups. Serve these with Dolcetto d'Alba, a mild red wine from the neighboring Piedmont region.
5014232~Buttermilk Ice Cream~5137~248~300~62~300~921~1132~To prevent curdling, be sure to cool the ice cream custard to room temperature before adding the buttermilk and crème fraîche.

5011993~Modern Mince Pie~3264~692~567~10~61~70~126~This dessert, long favored by the British at holiday time, originally contained minced meat along with the fruits and spices. This version, more suited to the nineties table, is meatless and brimming with apples, dried fruit and lots of spices.
5011994~Bourbon Baby Back Ribs~371~73~63~8~4~4026~26~Thin slices of sweet potato can be grilled alongside the ribs, then drizzled with maple syrup. Have coleslaw and corn bread on the side, too. End with lemon meringue pie.

5011999~Savory Lobster Bread Puddings with Vanilla Chive Sauce~4046~197~80~55~345~4343~951~At the Perryville Inn chef Paul Ingenito uses the succulent bits of meat from lobster knuckles in a bread pudding, which he bakes and serves in empty lobster tail shells as an adjunct to a whole lobster. We thought the pudding was stunning enough to stand on its own and so adapted the recipe, using the meat of a whole lobster for the pudding and the shells and body for the sauce.
5012000~Sausage and Bean Soup~826~24~7~33~60~5438~107~Complete the menu with a tomato and red onion salad, sourdough bread, and poached pears (or canned) with raspberry sauce.
5012001~Fettuccine with Shredded Zucchini, Fresh Ricotta, and Lemon Zest~3121~438~36~79~98~723~157~I realize that this seems almost too simple to mention, but it is such a perfect dish, and a good solution to a high-summer extravagance of zucchini and mint. And unlike some pasta dishes, it is light enough for a first course. I grate an additional bit of lemon zest over the finished dish.
5012002~Spicy Cabbage Salad With Turkey and Peanuts~1083~119~58~34~43~5000~92~After a heavy meal, we look for recipes that double as a palate cleanser, with spice, zing, and freshness. With some vegetables that, you know, still have some crunch.

5012009~Roast Chicken Noodle Soup with Chrysanthemum~2133~121~44~100~141~13802~366~If you're craving an aromatic Chinatown-style noodle soup, this recipe is a quick fix — especially if you use a roast chicken from the supermarket deli. (For another variation, try using roast duck from a Chinese deli instead.) The chrysanthemum leaves are a beautiful match with the delicate broth redolent of star anise, but watercress can be substituted if you like.

5012018~Grilled Baby Back Pork Ribs with Mustard-Bourbon Sauce~10820~962~809~697~460~33874~2575~Sometimes baby back ribs are sold in sections of four to six ribs rather than as whole racks; those will also work here. Begin preparing the ribs a day before serving so that they can chill overnight after the spice rub has been applied.
5013048~Quatre-Épices~7~1~1~0~0~0~0~"""Four-spices"" usually include four of five spices and are commonly used to season forcemeats for sausages and terrines. I include all five.

5012025~Turkey and Mushroom Risotto~2835~436~9~85~81~3814~258~"The best leftover dish is the first sandwich you make from what's left of the turkey, standing barefoot in a quiet kitchen lighted only by the dim bulb above the stove: thick toast with mayo and cranberry sauce and dressing and slices of just-carved meat.
No, scratch that (though it's delicious and you should make two or three). The best leftover recipe is risotto with turkey and wild mushrooms, the grains of rice plump with turkey broth and made nutty with cheese. The soft richness of the meal recalls Thanksgiving, then amplifies the memory, giving it a rakish flair."

It calls for only four ingredients and takes just 30 minutes to make. While it's not technically ricotta (Italian for ""recooked"") because it's not made by reheating whey (the liquid left over from making mozzarella), it boasts a fresher flavor and creamier texture than the stuff in your supermarket dairy aisle."

Running low on food, the owner, Caesar Cardini, threw together a salad with ingredients he had on hand.

Bird chile and passion fruit pavlova; Stilton mousse with walnut Florentine; apple, currant, and Brie pot pie. But some classics we knew not to amp up with ""bold flavors"" because they were sacred. Such is the tarte bourdaloue. This was one of the first desserts Matt and I were both taught to make in our classical pastry training; it is the pride of any French patisserie worth its (artisinal) salt, and you will treat it with some goddamn respect! Traditionally, it's a buttery tart crust filled with poached pear and luxurious almond cream. However, no matter how mind blowing the tarte bourdaloue is, almost no one in this country knows what it is."

5012097~Frisee with Crisped Salmon Skin and Warm Sherry Vinaigrette~635~47~7~0~41~20~0~In case you shy away from the pork-fat dressing of the classic frisee, you can always turn to this lighter, but equally delicious version, which substitutes crackling salmon skin for the lardons. Broiled salmon skin is a sushi bar staple, and the ginger in this dish echoes that connection. And further interest is provided by a very sympathetic dose of sherry vinegar. A multi-culti triumph!
5012098~Spaghetti alla Puttanesca~2649~354~34~36~114~2293~47~Martha mastered this classic dish during the couple's time in Italy. It's still one of her favorite recipes.

5012100~Dulce de Platanos~1946~257~254~0~108~71~292~Sweet Plantains with Buttered Rum and Coconut Sauce
5012101~Israeli Couscous with Roasted Butternut Squash and Preserved Lemon~3728~521~113~66~162~5030~0~A U-shaped peeler with a horizontal blade (available at most supermarkets) makes peeling the squash easier.
5012102~Pineapple Grapefruit Swirl~280~71~60~1~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5012103~Brined and Barbecued Turkey~2331~388~371~3~92~186318~253~This recipe was created by chef Traci Des Jardins of San Francisco's Jardinière. It's part of a special menu she created for Epicurious's Wine.Dine.Donate program.
5012104~Cauliflower Maque Choux~3232~201~95~21~270~3482~377~Highly recommended!
5012105~Homemade Coconut Yogurt~3969~445~279~55~226~3323~0~This homemade yogurt works well as a dairy-free alternative. We prefer making our own coconut milk over using canned—the flavor is much more fresh. To reuse the pressed coconut, dry it out in a low oven until no longer moist, then use in baked goods or sprinkle over yogurt.
5012106~Plum and Red-Wine Sorbet~1300~177~177~50~44~2343~157~The combination of plums and red wine gives this sorbet a stunning fuchsia color and a deep, fruit-filled flavor. Think of it as fruity mulled wine that's been frozen into a refreshing dessert.
5012108~Low-Fat Mango Flan with Orange and Mango Salad~1662~187~200~38~9~397~0~This refreshing dessert comes from Lincoln Carson, pastry chef at the Highlands Inn in Carmel Highlands, California. It has a lovely rich texture, even though it has no eggs.
5012109~Roast Pork Tenderloin with Fresh and Dried Fruit~1052~176~141~1~27~2156~0~"Gemma Sanita Sciabica of Modesto, California, writes: ""My husband's family produces olive oil, and I'm the company's recipe developer. We often hear from customers who love our oil but complain that they don't have the time to cook. Their comments inspired me to share my favorite recipes, which show just how simple great Italian food can be."""
5012110~Coconut Rice Puddings with Crispy Coconut~245~45~44~9~2~1693~4~For an extra kick, sprinkle a little ground cinnamon, ground cardamom, or finely grated lime peel over the rice puddings before serving.
5012111~Frozen Mango Daiquiri~1099~430~19~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5012112~Praline Pecan Tarts~4754~347~133~59~353~682~401~Highly recommended!
5012113~Asian Shrimp and Noodle Salad~912~133~15~72~10~4760~451~Crisp baby radishes, blanched snow peas and mini rice cakes make a light starter. The salad tastes even better with cold Asian beer to wash it down. For dessert, crumble coconut macaroons over orange sorbet.

5012115~Chorizo Hash Browns~3882~733~144~72~60~21299~41~We love hash browns for their delicious contradiction—the way the outer crunch of skillet–fried potatoes gives way to an inner creaminess. Throw in some nuggets of spicy Spanish chorizo (left over from Corn–Bread and Chorizo Stuffing ) and things only get better.
5012116~Curried Chicken Soup with Carrots~1340~95~51~98~64~3919~404~Highly recommended!
5012117~Cinnamon-Dusted Mini Churros~692~186~37~75~0~225~0~Serve with hot chocolate.
5014234~Cabbage Slaw~33~2~2~0~0~969~0~I've always loved coleslaws, using them as side dishes for everything from oyster rolls to whole grilled fish. Far from the chopped green cabbage with flecks of carrot from our school cafeteria days, the slaw can be quite elegant.
5012119~Zucchini in Pecan Brown Butter~548~27~23~4~50~158~63~"Chef Jimmy Bradley's wonderfully simple combinations of texture and flavor at New York City's The Red Cat were the inspiration for this zucchini dish—it makes a great accompaniment to ""lazy lasagne."""

5012122~Rum Raisin Apple Pie~489~81~54~9~19~48~32~Raisins steeped in dark rum mingle with tart and sweet apples in this updated version of an American favorite. It's a showstopper when paired with lightly sweetened whipped cream.
5016076~Crown Roast of Pork with Apple and Pork Stuffing and Cider Gravy~2026~294~211~46~78~25754~82~A simply spectacular main-course. Ask the butcher to grind any pork trimmings to use in the stuffing. Either hard cider or Pinot Noir would be delicious alongside.
5012124~Mango-Coconut Ice Cream Pies with Blackberry Sauce~2074~328~324~30~53~409~198~Highly recommended!
5012125~Spinach Soufflé with Shallots and Smoked Gouda Cheese~1586~145~80~36~87~2707~598~This terrific combination is very nice with baked ham.
5012126~Goat Cheese Crostini with Blood Orange and Black Pepper Marmalade~778~66~60~40~48~1201~159~The marmalade can also be served with a cheese plate or simply spread on toast.
5012127~Duck and Wild Mushroom Gumbo~6553~1293~43~142~88~19811~0~A refined version of a New Orleans classic. Ask the butcher to remove the backbone and quarter the duck.
5012128~Texican Rice~556~65~15~3~32~4499~63~Highly recommended!
5012129~Cajun Shrimp Stew~935~40~5~132~38~3424~1100~This satisfying stew just may be the essence of Cajun cooking: shrimp with onion, celery, and green pepper, all given depth by brown roux and livened up with cayenne.

5012132~Wende's Blue-Ribbon Apple Pie with Candied Ginger~1073~174~144~9~23~225~70~If you don't have apple brandy, simply substitute apple cider. In addition to the crystallized ginger, the cinnamon sugar sprinkled on the crust adds a lovely essence. To serve this very special pie, I suggest topping each slice with a bit of cheddar cheese.
5012133~Grilled Cumin-Lamb Pitas with Couscous and Yogurt~808~118~47~29~35~2475~31~The manly art of grilling reached its first peak in this decade, as dads stood by their Webers, stoking the fire and pulling dinner from its clutches while moms did the shopping and cleanup. Besides burgers and wienies, people loved to make shish kebab. Today, grilling knows no gender, and skewers remain a handy way to prepare small foods. Experience has taught us that the vegetables are best cooked separately, or not at all—as this hot-cold, tender-crunchy wonder of a sandwich illustrates.
5012134~Cherry and Coconut Granola with Yogurt~6431~790~237~183~290~2324~37~Highly recommended!

5012144~Roasted Parsnips, Turnips, and Rutabagas with Ancho-Spiced Honey Glaze~1153~171~75~9~43~309~63~The glaze adds just the right sweet-hot note to this interesting mix of vegetables. Try the roasted veggies with pork chops or chicken.
5014933~Sweet-Potato Coconut Purée~9803~2061~447~201~54~60631~0~Drawing her inspiration from the Caribbean, food editor Lillian Chou stirred lightly sweetened coconut milk into roasted sweet potatoes.

5012147~Fruit Salad with Ginger Syrup~2848~623~581~5~2~0~0~This recipe yields more ginger syrup than you'll need for the fruit salad. Add a spoonful to a glass of club soda, sparkling water, or iced tea for a refreshing summer drink.

5012154~Mom's Noodle Kugel~2078~399~127~61~23~2387~446~This was a recipe that came from my mother, Rae Horowitz. She told me it was from my Grandma Sade Lyon's recipe and she learned to make it from her.

5012157~Poached Apricots in Vanilla-Thyme Syrup with Crème Fraîche~2407~562~512~3~30~883~0~When buying fresh apricots, look for fruit that is plump, fragrant, and gives a little when squeezed. Poaching time depends on the ripeness of the fruit.
5012158~Sweet Potatoes with Cuban-Style Beef Picadillo~877~148~88~22~21~2724~23~To cut baking time, fork the tuber a few times, then nuke for 5 minutes.
5012159~Spiced Brown Butter Linzer Cookies~5375~800~430~182~280~2188~767~Make any kind of shape you'd like. The cookies can be rounds instead of rectangles, and you can use any smaller cutter for the cutouts.

5012162~Green Juice~404~28~13~3~30~844~0~Chef Hugo Bolanos of Los Angeles' Hotel Bel-Air shared this recipe exclusively with Epicurious. His turmeric-infused green juice features apples, celery, kale, and parsley but it's a flexible recipe, so feel free to experiment with different veggie combinations. Bolanos recommends swapping in Japanese cucumber for the celery, and substituting Swiss chard for the kale.
5012163~Linguine with Zucchini and Mint~4195~475~8~56~232~2137~0~Lightly frying the zucchini for this dish is the only step that takes a bit of time. And the result is wonderful; the thin slices, accented with garlic, mint, and lemon, meld perfectly with the pasta.
5012164~Strawberry-Rhubarb Sundaes~2206~379~371~50~44~2343~157~Strawberries and rhubarb are just two of the many flavorful produce varieties grown in this region. During fall and winter, the frozen versions stand up surprisingly well, especially in dishes like this compote, which we serve over ice cream or frozen yogurt for dessert or plain breakfast.
5012166~Herb Butter~718~0~0~0~78~118~214~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5012167~Brussels Sprouts with Bacon and Raisins~1460~163~76~64~68~2099~146~A little bit of bacon and a handful of raisins add a smoky sweetness that balances the slightly bitter flavor of the little cabbages.
5012168~Dance with a Dream~232~32~27~1~10~21~6~Highly recommended!
5012169~Vegetable Slaw with Miso Dressing~517~87~61~14~13~1365~17~This mix of jicama, cucumber, bell pepper, and carrot would also make a good side dish for scallops or shrimp. To keep the slaw crispy, add the dressing just before serving.

5012171~Apricot Sunburst~3126~764~412~24~0~7249~4~Like the Dried Pear Soufflé, this dessert relies on dried fruit rather than a lot of fat for richness. The glazed cherries add color; dried cherries may be substituted if you like. Any fresh fruit in season can be used to garnish the dessert.
5012172~Corn and Black Bean Tortilla Cakes~3351~83~24~194~243~5441~758~Highly recommended!

5012174~Roast Turkey with Pear and Port Gravy~2087~205~152~29~129~775~388~The fruity flavors of pear nectar and Port enchance a sage-accented gravy. Pour a rich Pinot Noir throughout the meal.

5012182~Spaghetti with Mussels and White Beans~3373~389~0~160~107~3630~489~Highly recommended!
5012183~Duck Confit with Oranges and Watercress~544~17~13~0~55~1~0~In French bistros, confit duck legs are traditionally served with a very simple, sharply dressed frisée salad. This version of the light meal gilds the lily by switching out frisée for peppery watercress and adding juicy navel oranges and nuggets of toasted walnuts.

Cobb, owner of the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood, is said to have invented this salad in the 1930s as a late-night snack for himself. No wonder it has remained an American classic. With the crunch of the iceberg and onions, the soft richness of the avocado, the saltiness of the bacon, the sweetness of the tomato, and the bite of the blue cheese, this salad has it all! And it is beautiful to boot.
5012189~French Toast Bread Pudding~1459~177~164~52~64~1112~383~Highly recommended!

5012193~Caramelized Figs with Vanilla Ice Cream and Aged Balsamic Vinegar~420~108~90~3~0~148~0~This dessert hits both sweet and savory notes. Aged balsamic vinegar has a syruplike consistency, so a little drizzle goes a long way.

5012198~Blueberry and Cream Cookies~9583~1349~425~138~383~4459~1382~"The ""cream"" flavor in this blueberry-muffin-inspired cookie comes from one of Tosi's favorite inventions—Milk Crumbs (a streusel made from dry milk powder). The key to the soft center and crunchy edges? Scooping the dough onto the baking sheets and letting the cookies rest in the fridge overnight. Timing note: You'll need to make the Milk Crumbs before you start preparing the cookie dough."

5012201~Chile and Chorizo Cornbread~4009~200~8~214~263~9539~1078~Just about every book we've ever seen on southwest cooking includes a recipe for one of the spicy cornbreads of the region. Once you've tasted one, you'll know why — they are really delicious. This version is more of a pudding than a bread because it is quite moist and cheesy in texture. It makes a wonderful side dish to replace potatoes or rice, or it is quite satisfying eaten as a light entrée or lunch with a salad of fresh young greens.
5012202~Pork Chops with Sauteed Red Cabbage~3185~334~238~60~175~46218~167~Highly recommended!

5019186~Canton Ginger Kick~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~Kick is the right word to describe this golden cocktail, which underscores the shot of ginger liqueur with ginger syrup and lemon.
5012208~Prunes in Wine with Toasted-Almond Cookies~3914~545~361~149~118~6318~421~Prunes take on a velvety texture in this Port sauce. The resulting syrup is silky and sweet, with a tropical vanilla fragrance.

5012210~Victory Garden Chicken-Vegetable Soup~3280~601~115~76~45~16778~44~Throughout World War II, everyone who had even a little plot of land was encouraged to grow a vegetable garden. Back then, this comforting soup would most frequently be made from water and contain no chicken, which was a Sunday treat. For convenience, you can skip the first part of this recipe and use six cups of stock or canned broth and omit the chicken altogether. But if you want to make the stock from scratch, be sure to do so a day ahead.
5012211~Swordfish with Olive, Pinenut, and Parsley Relish~1191~77~20~5~58~59~0~Highly recommended!
5012212~"Singapore ""Carrot Cake"""~3188~456~16~59~109~5298~380~"Once a favorite breakfast of the Chinese, this dish might more accurately be called a daikon scramble. But the Chinese words for carrot and daikon are almost the same, and ""cake"" refers to the way the rice flour binds the ingredients."

5012215~Pear, Pancetta, and Walnut Salad~1278~92~45~18~92~391~18~Toasted crushed coriander seeds add great flavor and fragrance to the dressing. Green Anjou or Comice pears would also work well here, but the red Anjou's rich maroon skin looks beautiful next to the lettuce.

5012221~Crustless Mini Quiches~919~5~2~68~67~3442~563~Here's a quiche recipe that goes wheat free without skimping on flavor. We call for broccoli and Cheddar cheese, but you can trade out the broccoli for asparagus tips or halved cherry tomatoes and the Cheddar for Gruyère, Swiss, or Comté.
5012222~Herbed Oyster Stuffing~1923~46~23~45~168~3157~341~This classic stuffing doesn't taste fishy at all — the chopped oysters simply lend some depth and moisture.
5012223~Indian Clarified Butter (Ghee)~714~0~0~0~78~0~214~Highly recommended!
5012224~"""Blanketed"" Eggplant"~5404~175~93~8~540~1206~0~"Arabs brought the eggplant to Sicily in the late tenth century and, in fact, the Italians once called eggplant radice arabica, or Arab root. It is an integral ingredient in Sicilian cuisine, and the variety of recipes featuring it — the most famous being caponata — is astounding.

5012232~Spiced Braised Lamb with Carrots and Spinach~403~55~11~3~16~3950~0~Sephardim (Jews of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean extraction) eat coriander seeds during Passover; if you do not because you are from an eastern European Jewish background, you can simply leave the coriander out of this recipe.

5012246~Snapper Sashimi with Seaweed and Fennel~350~15~7~4~30~542~4~The type of fish you use is less important than its quality. Black bass, striped bass, and fluke all translate well; ask your fish guy for what's freshest.

5012258~Chef's Salad~1364~81~28~10~110~139396~0~The chef's salad is a familiar yet fading star in the salad world. In delicatessens, diners, and airport snack bars everywhere, we find its faithful components: lifeless leaves of iceberg lettuce, suspiciously blue-hued slices of hard-boiled egg, wedges of pallid tomato, and rubbery chunks of cheese, ham, and turkey.

5012259~Shrimp Fried Rice with Ginger~1256~96~27~107~34~1278~880~Vegetables from the supermarket salad bar get an Asian spin. Start with purchased wonton soup, and serve a mixed green salad with ginger vinaigrette alongside the rice. Sliced pineapple with coconut sorbet is the perfect finish.

5012266~Shrimp Palermo~656~55~20~48~22~519~440~Nice accompaniments for this Sicilian-style shrimp dish are sautéed broccoli and some orzo (rice-shaped pasta; also called riso) with butter and lots of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. For dessert, serve sliced pears and almond cookies.

Study after study shows that traditional healers were right: these plants are medicine. This simple dish brings some serious plant power with the fresh herbs, mushrooms, olives, and quinoa. Mushrooms also contain unique phytonutrients, helping you round out this meal. For your next brunch, serve up some healing!
5012271~Crisp Eggplant Chips~7712~339~93~36~723~1818~0~Here, something savory becomes addictively sweet and salty. The confectioners sugar helps brown the eggplant, and panko adds crunch.
5012272~Lemon-Poppy Seed Waffles with Blueberry Sauce~3977~546~289~78~70~2738~496~"There are only five employees at The Little Rooster Cafe, a small breakfast and lunch spot, but its terrific food and friendly service make it popular with locals and tourists (especially those who come to browse the town's outlet stores). Chef and co-owner Hub Poelmann features a different waffle every day. ""We have an open kitchen,"" he says. ""People smell the waffles cooking, and then order them.""

We give the cherry tomatoes a little extra love in the oven to boost their flavor before we stir them into the beans. Rosemary is a natural in this dish, but its the generous amount of parsley added at the end thats the real revelation. The herb adds a zesty top note to the beans. Simple side dishes—garlic bread, a green salad—complete the picture.
5012275~Acme Hot Fudge Sundaes~7612~972~726~156~362~3526~1017~Homemade malted vanilla-bean ice cream is layered with a bittersweet chocolate sauce and drunken dried cherries.

5012277~Garlic and Rosemary Stuffed Mushrooms~202~33~0~0~3~31~10~Highly recommended!
5012278~Pasta with Chorizo and Chickpeas~2511~267~53~92~123~6951~240~"As co-chefs, Hudman and Ticer see each other daily, but the old friends still cook together on days off. ""Andy does the steak,"" says Hudman, ""and I do the pasta."""

5012284~Cumin-Roasted Potatoes with Caviar and Smoked Salmon~1780~95~27~28~140~10816~384~Preserved lemon, an essential ingredient in Moroccan cooking, is made by pickling lemons in salt, lemon juice, and olive oil. Here, preserving just the peel (begin at least a day ahead) is an easy way to add an exciting note to the crème fraäche.
5019890~Passion-Fruit Ice Cream~3951~366~354~21~293~382~1313~This recipe makes more ice cream than you'll need to fill the cones (see Coconut Tuile Cones with Passion-Fruit Ice Cream recipe), but it's so delicious you'll have no trouble getting rid of the leftovers.
5012286~Mashed Baked Potatoes With Chives~7939~1408~283~149~161~40742~425~Baking the potatoes for this recipe is a completely hands-off cooking process that also reduces some of the water content in the spuds, resulting in the easiest and most flavorful mash of all time.
5012287~Sweet Potato Noodle Stir-Fry with Choy Sum and Shiitake Mushrooms~1710~129~89~20~125~4585~0~"""What really makes this Korean- inspired dish delightful is the contrast between the crisp vegetables and the soft, chewy sweet potato noodles,"" says Mai Pham. Look for the noodles at Asian markets; cellophane noodles (sold in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets) also work here. For best results, choose a thicker noodle, about the size of spaghettini. Serve this dish at room temperature as a side or main."
5012288~Asparagus Gremolata~370~66~10~15~3~264~10~We’re just obsessed with using asparagus as a condiment! Try sprinkling this crunchy mix over eggs or tossing it into pasta.

5012294~Sunday Sauce with Sausage and Braciole~10086~983~169~604~446~25046~1564~Ask anybody's nonna: Making Sunday sauce is not an exact science. You can use other meats—like thick pork chops or short ribs—in place of or in addition to the ones listed here.

5017126~Sweet Shallot Vinaigrette~2161~29~21~0~236~23~0~This is a light and very easy vinaigrette. I recommend serving it with any salad on which you'd like to use a flavorful but light dressing.
5012300~Mexican Oysters~450~25~8~21~33~556~13~Also try the salsa with some corn bread or scrambled eggs for a spicy treat.

5012311~Baked Mini Pumpkin Pots~897~93~78~33~41~2062~487~"I think ""pumpkin pots"" might just be one of my new word combinations. Pumpkin pots. Pumpkin pots. Pumpkin pots.

5012323~African Adobo-Rubbed Tuna Steaks~2383~144~80~12~189~10506~27~Adobo means spice rub or marinade, and this particular recipe was introduced by African slaves and brought to Bahía in Brazil in the 17th century. I think that it gives tuna a new and exciting dimension. There is spiciness in the dish, as would be expected from an adobo. To provide the American palate a little relief from the heat, the tuna is served on a bed of lightly pickled cucumbers.
5012324~Marinated Feta With Roasted Lemon~1033~32~6~0~93~2321~0~Try this with white beans on toast, in salads, or puréed and spread on pita.
5012326~Grilled Cheddar, Tomato and Bacon Sandwiches~1306~89~14~52~96~2602~178~Spreading a little mayonnaise over the outside of the bread before grilling adds golden color and delicious crunch.

5012330~Celery-Root Soup with Bacon and Green Apple~1556~79~18~42~112~5153~174~Silky smooth and with a crunchy topping, this seductive soup packs a range of flavors — earthy, smoky, and tart-sweet. If you decide to omit the bacon, substitute 1 tablespoon butter when you cook your vegetables.
5012331~Stir-Fried Pork with Five Vegetables~1199~173~76~65~26~2663~75~Serve this dish with brown rice.
5012332~Passion-Fruit Meringues~571~138~137~9~0~210~4~This dessert can be transformed to fit occasions other than Valentine's Day. Try experimenting with round, square, or triangular meringue shapes. And even though you'll only need 4 meringue layers, the recipe calls for 6—thus allowing for the possibility of breakage…or snacks!

5012337~Salted Caramel Ice Cream~3243~322~320~19~229~1520~1105~It might seem odd to describe something cold—ice cream—as sultry, but there is no denying genuine come-hither appeal. Based on a traditional candy from Brittany (and a favorite flavor pairing among French and American chefs), the combination of salty and sweet exerts an almost primordial pull, and cream, milk, and eggs provide lush, luxurious texture.

5012339~Blue Cheese Vinaigrette~1534~23~14~38~146~3543~157~Highly recommended!
5012340~Strawberry–Pistachio Crumble Pie~2856~414~179~57~127~1130~218~Juicy, fruit-filled pies call for a baked-through bottom crust.
5012341~Autumn Soup with Crispy Bacon~1267~155~88~35~53~1648~115~Based on two root vegetables, this soup tastes sophisticated nonetheless.

5012344~Sweet and Sour Strawberry Semifreddo with Black Sesame~2144~61~29~14~213~197~657~You don't need an ice-cream maker to serve cool, creamy scoops. All you need is a bowl to make semifreddo happen.

5012346~Steamed Mussels with Sofrito~577~60~19~14~18~2451~47~Sofrito is a sautéed vegetable mixture used as a seasoning in Spain, Italy and Latin America.
5019486~French Toast~707~106~54~27~18~3844~398~French toast is always better if your bread is a little dry — a day or two old, or leave the slices out overnight. Serve these crusty slices with bacon and warmed maple syrup, jam, or marmalade, or sprinkle them with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar.
5012348~Moroccan Garbanzo Bean and Feta Pitas~1882~79~14~52~161~2981~167~If you can't find the Moroccan spice blend at the supermarket, combine 1 tablespoon ground cumin with 1/4 teaspoon each of ground coriander, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper. Serve with: Romaine salad and bowls of mixed green and black olives. Dessert: Purchased apricot tart.

5012351~Pasta and Chicken Gratin~3007~224~95~65~206~5776~1007~Think macaroni and cheese — only ten times better. This sophisticated version combines the nuttiness of Gruyère with the intense flavor of parmesan, juicy poached chicken, and a crisp, cheesy crust. If you're short on time, feel free to use cooked rotisserie chickens (see cooks' note, below). In that case, though, don't add salt to the sauce, as the stock made from the rotisserie chickens will already be salty.

Our mint chip ice cream is a creamy white speckled with chocolate chips and is one of our best sellers. It's incredibly easy to make and is most certainly a crowd-pleaser. We recommend showing some restraint with the mint extract—after all, you can always add more—lest your ice cream wind up tasting like toothpaste.

5012490~Curried Mussel and Potato Chowder with Peas~4819~789~183~215~49~25306~468~A rich-tasting low-fat chowder with lots of spicy curry flavor.
5012491~"Cauliflower ""Couscous"" With Dried Fruit and Almonds"~1081~131~87~17~59~1707~0~"We swap in richly spiced cauliflower ""rice"" for semolina in this nutritious and gluten-free take on couscous. Serve it as a side for grilled vegetables or meats or hearty stews like Easy Lamb Tagine with Pomegranate."
5012492~Shaved Raw Brussels Sprouts with Castelrosso~450~104~35~33~0~1203~0~Brussels sprouts aren't the first ingredient anybody thinks of when they think of Italian food, but this salad takes a basic equation from the Italian kitchen—fresh vegetables, olive oil, and a little bit of Italian cheese—and makes the sprouts work in the context of the cuisine. It's also a healthier, fresher salad for the winter months.
5012493~Chunky Gazpacho~881~94~42~11~49~1435~17~Highly recommended!
5012494~Basmati Rice, Microwave Method for Cooking~1727~373~0~36~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5012495~Toasted Manioc Flour With Eggs and Scallions (Farofa de Ovo e Cebolinha)~709~17~5~17~63~375~443~Farofa is the term for a side dish using toasted farinha de mandioca—in English, manioc flour, which is a dried flour similar in looks and texture to breadcrumbs, made from yucca. The making of farofa as a dish couldn't be easier. It is plain manioc flour toasted in butter. A few of the classic farofa dishes include eggs and scallions, eggs and bacon, banana, bell peppers, and dendê oil, green beans and carrots, peas and corn, and so on and so forth. Farofa can be extremely dry, since the manioc flour immediately sucks up all the juices from anything it encounters, especially when it's served plain. The trick to making a moist farofa is to use a small amount of manioc flour in proportion to the other components, turning a side dish into a savory accompaniment that is so tempting, you may even forget there is a main course.
5012496~Thai-Style Chicken and Vegetable Stir-Fry~583~12~6~19~48~807~45~Spoon this over rice noodles or linguine, and have a crisp coleslaw of bean sprouts, shredded cabbage and slivered red bell pepper alongside. To finish, drizzle white rum over fresh pineapple and banana chunks.
5015741~Beer-Marinated Flank Steak with Aji and Guacamole~607~67~21~37~61~1593~45~Colombia may be the best kept barbecue secret in South America. Sure, Argentina gets the attention for its cowboy-style asado. And Brazil has enjoyed spectacular success exporting its rodizio-style restaurants—the kind where the waiters parade spits of grilled meats through the dining room. But Colombia? I doubt that most North Americans could name a single Colombian grilled dish. Well, it's time to shine the spotlight on the only country in South America to have coasts on both the Atlantic and the Pacific, whose cool-weather ranching district produces well-marbled, full-flavored beef, whose grill masters make extensive use of marinades (unlike the simplicity prized by their Argentine counterparts), and whose mastery of the art of grilling on charcoal extends to some unique techniques. Here's a not-so simple flank steak redolent of cumin, green onions, and beer.
5012498~Cornish Game Hens with Dried Fruit and Honey~1857~210~144~27~105~2587~0~This poultry dish features many of the flavors of the classic Moroccan dish b'stilla but is much easier to make.
5012499~Dried Cherry and Ginger Cannoli~5692~769~712~91~236~1703~771~For best results, use fresh ricotta, which is sold at Italian delis and specialty cheese shops. Avoid packaged brands that include gelatin and preservatives, as these can be watery and have a grainy texture. Prepared cannoli shells are sold at Italian markets.
5012501~Bacon-Wrapped Turkey Breast with Hazelnut Mole~6335~36~0~300~543~14697~1098~What to drink: Roberto Santibañez recommends a Petite Sirah (a full-bodied, peppery red wine varietal) from L.A. Cetto in Mexico's Guadelupe Valley. Or try the Guenoc Petite Sirah from California's North Coast.
5012502~Marinated Rack of Lamb with Mustard and Vinegar~799~59~40~0~55~1419~0~Begin marinating the lamb one day ahead.

5012504~Middle Eastern Nut-Filled Multilayered Pastry (Baklava)~5306~613~298~147~257~2871~0~"Baklava (from the Farsi for ""many leaves""), a pastry perfected by royal bakers in the sultan's palace in Istanbul, consists of layers of phyllo filled with nuts and spices and drenched in a syrup. It has become a traditional Middle Eastern Rosh Hashannah and Purim treat but is enjoyed at celebrations throughout the year. There are numerous variations of baklava, many a closely guarded secret passed down within families. A walnut filling is more prevalent in the Levant, while pistachios and pistachio-almond fillings are preferred in Iran. Blanched almonds are traditional on Rosh Hashannah to produce a light color so that the year should be dulce y aclarada (""sweet and bright""). Sephardim refrain from serving dark-colored pastries such as those made from walnuts on Rosh Hashannah, which would portend a dark year. Although purists disdain anything except the classic nut filling, some cooks innovated by adding such items as dates and chocolate chips. Hungarians make an apricot version. This very rich treat is usually served in small portions."
5012505~Iced Mint Tea~667~183~100~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5012507~Ricotta and Cherry Strudel~11593~2162~1303~230~226~3350~1119~With Lidia by your side, this showstopping dessert is foolproof. You'll need to start preparing the dough and filling at least one day ahead.
5012508~Mexican Fruit Cooler~916~225~142~0~0~4452~0~Highly recommended!
5012509~Eggnog Cremes~2927~569~483~40~56~1606~292~Crunchy candy-coated cranberries make festive garnish for this inventive dessert. Begin preparing the custards a day before serving.
5012510~Build-Your-Own Thanksgiving Pie Bar~501~83~30~19~10~634~5~Can’t decide which pie to make (or dig into)? Let your guests in on the fun, and get a little taste of everything, with this fun do-it-yourself Thanksgiving Pie Bar. Prepare all five toppings for maximum sugary fun, or pick and choose your favorites for a more streamlined preparation.
5012511~Pink Grapefruit, Grape, Raspberry, and Olive Oil Salad with Minted Yogurt~896~177~134~1~20~0~0~Olive oil in a dessert might seem a little odd, but try to think of it as a flavorful ingredient rather than a fat...as long as you choose a delicious extra-virgin oil. I first had something like this in Jabugo, Spain, when I ate slices of orange simply drizzled with a grassy local oil as a dessert. It was a revelation. If you want to go dairy-free in this dessert, then skip the yogurt and mix the mint in with the grapes.
5012512~Spinach Ohitashi~617~58~31~27~19~15040~0~This deep savory dressing makes simply cooked vegetables come to life.
5015578~Asian Cabbage Salad~502~63~63~0~29~2997~0~Highly recommended!
5012514~Chile-Lime Cashews~6127~344~133~169~491~7775~63~Kaffir lime leaves give this spiced nut mix its citrusy, floral notes. Can't find any? Just double the lime zest.
5012515~Garlic-Rosemary Turkey with Mushroom Gravy~2134~82~18~17~148~15066~126~A rich paste of roasted garlic and fresh rosemary is rubbed under the skin and over the bird. It also gives a boost to the gravy.
5012516~Rigatoni with Duck Ragù~2817~442~43~77~80~1349~76~Cracklings made from the leftover duck skin top this satisfying pasta dish.
5012517~Cheddar, Red Pepper, and Horseradish Spread~267~13~10~10~20~2374~33~Try this with your next roast beef or pork sandwich, on either pumpernickel or rye.
5012518~Broccoli and Broccoli Rabe with Roasted Red Peppers~2491~192~89~153~125~11179~351~The peppers can be roasted and the broccoli blanched a day ahead, leaving just the sautéing to do before serving. This dish is equally delicious served right off the stove or at room temperature.
5012519~Marinated Shrimp with Pickled Watermelon Rind~964~34~22~120~36~5972~1100~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5012520~Pan-Seared Venison with Rosemary and Dried Cherries~1031~135~74~30~34~12181~66~Highly recommended!
5012521~Steak Mole with Cilantro~392~43~29~3~20~472~5~Serve this quick flavor-packed steak with sliced avocado, orange, and red onion. Canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce are sold at supermarkets and Latin markets.
5019221~Incredible Melted Ice-Cream Cake~1715~15~15~27~183~2505~843~Pillsbury test kitchen home economists have heard it all. When they told me some people were adding melted ice cream to a cake mix, I couldn't believe it. Well, that's precisely what I did with this fun recipe. Choose your flavor and let the ice cream melt. The only trick is that you must have 2 cups of melted ice cream. For super-premium ice creams with little overrun, that's 1 pint frozen. But for less expensive brands with a lot of air piped in, you'll need to begin with more than a pint.
5017184~Cranberry-Crab Rangoon~4816~556~461~335~129~6153~1797~Editor's note: This recipe is from Ming Tsai's book, Ming's Master Recipes.

5012526~Beet and Cabbage Salads~2451~256~171~22~146~7236~0~These vegetables are served as an on-table condiment at Chez Navarre. They are also great served side by side on their own or with beef or pork.

5012532~Fennel and Orange Salad~2443~132~87~2~220~405~0~Highly recommended!
5012534~Texas-Style Smoked Brisket~148~12~3~8~7~279~35~In Texas, barbecue is about beef: specifically brisket, the cut by which any joint is judged. Brisket has become a favorite of restaurant chefs, too, hence the smoke ribbons and Hank Williams songs drifting out of restaurants as far away as Brooklyn. But can great brisket be made at home? I devoted a weekend to the task and learned that with a few key ingredients— salt, pepper, patience, and advice from Aaron Franklin, my neighbor and the pitmaster at Franklin Barbecue in Austin—swoonworthy results are doable. You just have to take the time—12 smoky hours.
5012535~Water Spinach with Shrimp~487~18~7~23~33~2339~194~Kangkong Masak Lemak
5012536~Basil Buttermilk Dressing~167~33~0~0~0~484~0~This tangy dressing really livens up a plate of crisp salad greens. It's also great on a baked potato or as a dip.
5012537~Roasted Eggplant and Pickled Beet Sandwiches~2477~89~10~8~208~3350~136~Meatless doesn't mean dainty. When making a veggie-centric sandwich, load up on aggressive flavors and contrasting textures, and be sure to add something substantial to sink your teeth into, like roasted vegetables, sliced hardboiled eggs, or mashed beans. This vegetarian powerhouse from Brooklyn's Saltie balances salty feta and olives with a salad-like mix of fresh herbs. Plenty of pickled, vinegary ingredients (this one uses capers and pickled beets, but any pickled veg would work) keep the full-flavored components bright.
5019959~Lamb and Eggplant Moussaka~1420~203~61~32~63~8730~52~Making moussaka is something of an undertaking—a rich meat sauce (made here with lamb, but you can substitute other ground meats such as turkey, veal, or even pork, if you prefer), layered with tender eggplant and a cheese sauce. You can make the moussaka in two smaller casserole dishes to serve one now and freeze one to bake later.
5012539~Pasta With Mushrooms and Prosciutto~1520~216~6~57~37~2476~367~Getting the consistency of the creamy mushroom sauce right is key for this pasta recipe. You want to reduce it just until it clings to the pasta to create a light coating; be careful not to reduce it too much.
5012540~Braised Onions with Orange and Balsamic Vinegar~721~66~61~1~50~205~63~At Restaurant Biga in San Antonio, owner-chef Bruce Auden's co-chef, Mark Bliss, created this lovely side dish. He pairs it with roast pork, chicken or lamb. Cipolline onions are small, sweet Mediterranean onions; they are available at some supermarkets.
5012541~Fridge-Dive Pesto Pasta~1035~61~3~19~77~379~63~This pesto pasta recipe is the solution for any leftover hardy green, lettuce, or herb you don’t know what to do with. Cleaning out your fridge has never been so rewarding!

5012544~Hazelnut Meringue Drops~1281~191~121~24~47~195~4~Hazelnuts give these airy and crunchy nuggets a distinctive flavor.
5012545~Beef and Wild Mushrooms~4612~366~163~226~257~125289~361~Saltimporten sources only the freshest wild mushrooms available and uses them raw in this dish. If using less-than-pristine mushrooms, sauté them quickly in a neutral-flavored oil, such as grapeseed or vegetable oil.
5012546~Red Potato and Green Bean Salad with Dijon Vinaigrette~4922~1028~210~101~25~30663~0~This lovely side can be made a day ahead.
5012547~Marinated Olives with Tangerine and Rosemary~1514~25~32~3~0~100~0~Begin marinating the olives at least two and up to five days ahead.

5012557~Corn and Okra Stew~1427~181~28~45~52~7840~232~Like gumbo, this is a thick and flavorful stew. But it takes a lot less time to make.
5012558~Scallops with Vegetables, Ginger and Cream~1699~79~35~32~127~1552~436~Highly recommended!
5012559~Roast Beef, Saga Blue, and Watercress with Horseradish Mayonnaise on French Bread~879~77~33~27~53~1914~94~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012560~Veal Osso Buco (Ossobuco alla Milanese)~1837~151~36~41~122~3974~0~This recipe is part of the Epicurious Online Cooking School, in partnership with the Culinary Institute of America. To watch it being made, and to learn how to make other Italian classics, check out the videos.
5012561~Seafood Mold~1699~74~14~124~97~3482~289~"Don't let the unappetizing-sounding name fool you: I'm talking about mold as in ""shape"" here. I'm from New Orleans, which means I grew up with a lot of socializing, most of it centered around food. There, both the front door and the refrigerator door are always open for friends or family who drop in. My mother always seems to have a steady stream of visitors, whether it's a neighbor who's stopped by for tea, one of her many siblings who happen by at dinnertime, or me with a whole troop of friends in for Mardi Gras or Jazz Fest. True New Orleanian that she is, she always has something good to eat. This seafood mold is a common dish at parties all around the city, and as improvisation is the hallmark of New Orleans cooking, each chef has her own version. I haven't gotten to the stage where I've made my own mark on this recipe yet, so I just copy Mom's."
5012562~Coffee-Marinated Bison Short Ribs~4546~567~100~408~143~53966~957~The coffee marinade is sweetened slightly with a little maple syrup, and the sauce gets a kick thanks to a jalapeño chile.
5013248~Stone Fruit Cobbler~4535~696~582~82~193~1989~624~Don't peel the peaches; simply rub off the fuzz with a damp paper towel.
5012565~Chili Bean Soup~1054~121~14~43~40~2342~63~Highly recommended!
5012567~Beef and Potato Pasties~2914~274~5~176~198~5727~584~"The Cornish pasty, a meat-filled hand pie (rhymes with ""nasty,"" not ""hasty""), was brought to northern Michigan by English immigrants, who ate it for lunch as they worked in the mines. For good reason—it's portable, fortifying food with straightforward flavor. A pasty-eating tradition remains in the region; they're nowadays typically served with butter and ketchup."
5012568~Tarragon, Chive and Goat Cheese Omelet~1090~10~10~64~96~2884~642~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5017862~Stir-Fried Spinach with Ginger and Garlic~251~33~0~0~9~0~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012570~Almond-Cherry Chocolate Bark~2661~229~161~62~186~1214~67~Chocolaty almonds are better than a gift certificate for a facial. Vitamin E in the nuts gives skin a healthy glow, and chocolate— well, do we really need to sell you on that?
5012571~Swedish Meringue Cake with Strawberries and Orange Filling~5973~1055~692~101~155~2169~603~Highly recommended!
5017257~Carrot Cardamom Soup~2161~213~56~32~89~16770~163~"Aromatic spice and herb blends can quickly turn an ordinary soup recipe into something extraordinary. Here they transform a basic carrot soup into a special concoction you'll crave again and again. So start utilizing the ""cook once, eat twice"" theory; just freeze half of the recipe or make a double batch whenever possible."
5012573~Minted Mediterranean Couscous Salad~1700~229~19~64~55~3684~83~Offer this meatless main-course salad with a basket of seeded flatbreads, steamed artichokes, and a lemon-mayo dipping sauce. Follow the meal with a bowl of apricots and some purchased baklava.
5012574~Tuna and Artichoke Panini~477~42~2~22~19~1490~57~Highly recommended!
5012575~Olive-Oil Cake with Candied Orange~4057~777~584~73~122~2644~370~A mild or fruity olive oil works best in this cardamom-scented cake. Just try not to eat all of the candied orange slices before the cake cools.
5012576~Tangerine-Ginger Caipirinhas~316~77~77~0~0~10~0~The Caipirinha is Brazil's most popular cocktail. The drink is traditionally made with limes, but Amber uses tangerines instead.
5012577~Grilled Broccoli and Arugula Salad~1741~111~58~60~92~1636~151~An unexpected side dish that can be made hours ahead of a party; wait until the last minute to toss together.
5012578~Root Vegetable Fries~1159~148~39~11~53~3007~0~Roasted potatoes are good and all, but a roasted root vegetable medley is just as easy to make and a little bit fancy too. Substitute any root vegetable, including starchy potatoes, turnip, parsnip, celery root, or rutabaga. While the veggies are roasting, toss a garlic bulb or two into the pan at about the 30-minute mark—the result: easy, creamy garlic! Yum.
5012579~Mediterranean Eggplant and Barley Salad~5369~548~93~137~303~100568~316~The deep flavors in this lush and hearty dish are too good for anyone to pass up. Vegetarians can substitute water for the chicken broth and still enjoy the succulent, melt-in-your-mouth eggplant.
5012580~Mango and Avocado Salad with Peanut Dressing~670~58~31~18~37~2001~0~Here's a very simple salad that's loaded with Southeast Asian flavor.
5012581~Apricot Almond Scones~2603~500~156~163~82~2558~370~Highly recommended!
5012583~Barbecued Pork Fried Rice~545~61~37~12~20~6055~0~For an especially quick and easy meal, buy prepared Chinese barbecued pork loin (3/4 pound will be plenty). This pink-tinged meat is available at many Asian supermarkets—or you may even be able to purchase it from your neighborhood Chinese restaurant.
5012584~Curried Spinach Dip~557~59~15~11~26~535~7~Serve this zesty dip with crackers or cut-up raw vegetables.

5012586~Creamy Chia Coconut Ginger-Carrot Soup~309~50~10~0~7~2821~0~Coconut milk is a staple in Thai cooking, but you don't have to limit it to Asian food; it's a great resource for making anything super yummy and creamy. I like Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk. To give this velvet soup a tiny bit of crunch and extra visual appeal, chia seeds are stirred in after the soup is pureed.
5012587~Shrimp Escabèche with Blood Orange Mojo~4551~635~484~265~107~7278~1761~This dish combines Spanish escabeche (marinated poached fish) with a new take on mojo, a Cuban sauce typically made with the juice of tart oranges, garlic, and herbs.

5012602~Cashew-Coconut Tart in Chocolate Crust~5540~645~317~78~316~1042~739~There's a layer of chocolate between the cookie-like crust and the rich filling of this sophisticated spin on the traditional pecan pie.
5012603~Chicken Tagine with Spring Vegetables~4691~177~39~351~287~6649~1616~What to drink: Abarbanel 2001 Syrah, Vin de Pays de l'Aude, France (kosher) or Clos du Bois 1999 Reserve Shiraz, Alexander Valley.
5012604~Sherried Sweet Potatoes and Apples~817~99~78~0~46~30~126~Highly recommended!
5012606~Roast Side of Salmon with Mustard, Tarragon, and Chive Sauce~124~32~32~0~0~1~0~Here's a quick way to feed a crowd. The salmon is also great made ahead and served chilled.
5017518~Grilled Clams on the Half Shell with Ginger Mignonnette~747~7~0~28~76~93987~71~It's best to shuck your own clams, but if you buy them on the half shell, be sure to ask for the clam liquor.
5012608~Fish Skewers with Tarragon Vinaigrette~373~53~1~33~0~1948~0~Shrimp or sea scallops would also work well in this recipe. Serve with: Grilled plum tomatoes, herbed orzo salad, and grilled French bread.
5012609~Grilled Brined Chicken with Chimichurri Sauce~1904~102~28~0~165~23284~0~At John J. Jeffries, the chicken is served with seasonal heirloom tomatoes, arugula, and watercress. Ask the butcher to quarter the chicken and remove the backbone. Start preparing the recipe at least seven hours ahead.
5012610~Applesauce with Butter Pecan Crumbs~272~27~21~1~17~53~31~Highly recommended!
5012611~Swiss Chard Ricotta Gnudi with Fall Mushrooms~2050~169~33~104~104~10048~235~Gnudi is a type of gnocchi, made from ricotta cheese and a little bit of flour. The result is a dumpling that's as light and fluffy as a cloud. The dumpling dough needs to chill overnight, so begin this one day ahead.
5012612~Maple-Glazed Acorn Squash with Currants~835~33~29~2~78~0~214~Highly recommended!
5012613~Arugula Salad with Garlic Balsamic Vinaigrette~842~72~30~6~55~667~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012614~Braised Swiss Chard With Bacon and Hot Sauce~1592~82~34~55~113~4043~198~For this recipe, the greens taste best if sautéed just before serving, but you can cook the bacon and stems ahead; leave the pan on an unlit burner 'til go time.
5012616~Sweet Corn Pie~803~49~12~35~50~706~552~Highly recommended!
5016263~Blue Corn Bread~3917~433~61~85~226~3876~754~I first created this recipe at Routh Street Cafe in 1984. I've since had it on menus at five different restaurants in some form or another. It's also delicious when spread with a mixture of one part jalapeño jelly and three parts cream cheese whipped together. It's also best served warm.
5013137~Tea-and-Lemon Gravy~2026~71~25~21~189~8812~315~Highly recommended!

5012622~Scrambled Eggs with Tomato, Goat Cheese, and Mint~1036~112~82~37~56~2879~505~Highly recommended!
5015881~Thai Red Curry Paste~184~36~7~0~0~1079~0~If you're short on time, you can substitute bottled red curry paste (we recommend Mae Ploy brand) for homemade, but the flavor will not be as nuanced. There will be some curry paste left over after making the jungle curry and steamed catfish. Simply stir the remainder together with unsweetened coconut milk to give chicken, shrimp, or mussels a Thai spin.
5013376~Seafood Chowder with Squash~5163~597~107~358~85~174625~758~In every good restaurant kitchen, there's a combination of thrift and innovation. We always have a dish like this chowder on the menu because when we portion fish for main courses, there are inevitably some pieces of our excellent, sushi-quality fish too small to serve on their own. And that is another great reason to buy your fish whole: not only can you save the bones and head for fish stock, but you'll be generating two meals from one shopping trip.
5012625~Mexican Chocolate Torte~3217~217~146~81~239~2841~523~(Toasted Almond, Cinnamon and Chocolate Torte)
5012626~Pizzaiola Burgers~1665~151~57~87~78~3862~165~This quick, casual recipe endows beef burgers with the flavors of a great pizza.
5019685~Pickled Red Onions with Cilantro~1008~245~229~1~0~2070~0~This recipe is an accompaniment for Grilled Steaks with Red Chile Sauce.
5012629~Strawberry Napoleons with Lemon Cream~4077~551~463~39~179~864~543~Phyllo dough gives this dessert a crisp texture that contrasts nicely with the smooth lemon filling.

5012633~Poppy Seed Layer Cake with Strawberries and White Chocolate Cream~12789~1506~902~152~594~3862~2447~Highly recommended!
5012634~Moroccan-Spiced Pastitsio with Lamb and Feta~6685~710~230~276~304~8980~1312~This multi-culti recipe brings a moroccan flavor (the spice blend ras-el-hanout) to pastitsio, the classic Greek pasta dish.
5012635~Spiced Lamb Patties with Nutty Garlic Sauce~3263~291~153~121~188~7606~367~You'll love this spiced alternaburger with its fresh finishes; kids will love the handheld dinner.
5012636~Chicken, Onion, and Raisin Stew~2055~274~247~13~82~1878~0~Highly recommended!

5012639~Chocolate Chip-Macadamia Nut Bars with Shortbread Crust~4931~707~415~61~211~613~796~Highly recommended!
5012640~Steamed Salmon Salad with Grapefruit-Ginger Dressing~1150~108~20~66~49~2622~66~It's tough to find a better source of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids than salmon. Add greens, grapefruit, and avocado, and you're well on your way to your 5 a Day.
5012641~Linguine with Herbed Clam Sauce~1095~193~11~34~27~843~63~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5012648~Alternative Oatmeal-Raisin Cookies~8762~1410~670~133~289~5455~1057~"The ""alternative"" is the addition of oat bran."
5012649~Cheer Cooler~141~26~22~0~3~145~3~Highly recommended!
5018998~Salmon Chowder~2693~297~66~109~90~9837~335~My mom makes the most delicious salmon chowder. It always reminds me how tasty leeks are. The combination of tomatoes and cream creates a pretty pink base.
5012651~Chicken with Roasted Lemon and Rosemary Sauce~262~15~5~18~11~688~76~In 1997, my Tra Vigne crew and I cooked for a week at the Mandarin-Oriental in Bangkok, Thailand. The hotel's chef wouldn't let me leave without giving him this recipe. It will look familiar to everyone, but wait until you taste it.
5012652~Cucumber Dill Spears and Chips~167~33~0~0~0~23264~0~Processing your pickles in a hot-water bath rather than a boiling-water bath will give you a firmer texture. It follows that if you want pickles with real snap, don't process them at all. These dill-pickle spears—or sandwich chips, depending on how you slice them—can be processed, if you want, for long-term shelf storage, but first try making a batch to keep in the refrigerator. They will be crisp, and the flavor of raw cucumber comes through. It's the freshest-tasting pickle in this book, and perhaps my favorite. The recipe can be scaled up.
5012653~Kiwi-Pomegranate Angel Pies~2176~380~343~30~65~1154~224~Guests will go wild for these little pies. They're at once delicate and decadent, the airy puffs of crisp meringue giving way to rich, vanilla-flavored pastry cream and a sprightly mix of fresh fruit.
5012654~Pork Chops with Leeks in Mustard Sauce~1826~198~68~59~72~7217~165~If you use commercial pork in this recipe, you might want to rub the chops with the salt mixture and let them sit for a full day in the fridge. The long rest will make the meat extra-juicy. Bone-in heirloom rib chops have ample marbling, so the meat will be naturally moist. They dont need to rest as long with the salt rub—an hour or two should be sufficient. These are some big chops, so you might be able to share.
5012655~Irish Soda Bread~2129~596~155~180~23~3909~63~"""When I was a small child, my father used to take my elder brother and me to New York City for St. Patrick's Day,"" writes Stephanie Foley of Massapequa, Long Island. ""We would spend the morning marching in the parade while my mother, back in Long Island, prepared a feast of corned beef, cabbage, and potatoes. But what we all truly looked forward to was her Irish soda bread. It's savory and substantial — and unlike any other I have tried. I hope you all enjoy it as much as we do."""
5012656~Strawberries with Zabaglione~353~51~42~13~10~226~371~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012657~Maple-Walnut Granola with Dried Cranberries~4643~968~463~93~44~129~2~Egg whites replace the usual oil or butter.
5012658~Japanese-Style Fried Rice (Chahan)~6614~1243~13~136~97~8432~574~There is no better use for leftover rice than chahan. A brief trip in a pan resurrects the grains and a few pantry ingredients—little more than eggs, oil, and salt—transform tired rice into a super-satisfying meal. To give the humble dish a little flair, I whip up a saucy broth filled with vegetables and shrimp and pour it on at the last minute. Of course, you can add any ingredients you like—peas or asparagus, kimchi or Japanese pickles, pork, or even, as I do at Morimoto Napa, duck confit.
5018096~Chicken and Biscuits~3682~328~62~214~243~11300~835~Homey and old-fashioned, this comforting dish can be on the table in a flash, thanks to store-bought rotisserie chicken and biscuits made with self-rising flour.
5014906~Greek Yogurt Ice Cream~1126~214~210~37~15~520~72~Highly recommended!
5012662~Creamy Chocolate-Cheese Flan with Hibiscus Sauce~4026~538~486~72~162~2016~731~"I love how the fruitiness of Cluizel Concepción chocolate, mellowed by a little cream cheese, plays against the caramel and the flowery, slightly musky acidity of the blossoms (actually, calyces) called ""Jamaica flowers"" in Mexico and red hibiscus in this country. (They are what gives Red Zinger tea its color.) When I first developed this recipe, I used hibiscus to flavor the caramel, but now I include it in a separate sauce where its red color makes a gorgeous contrast with the dark flan."
5012663~Roasted Pepper Turkey with Orange Liqueur~379~4~4~25~29~4470~105~I make this for a holiday dinner or when I'm planning to have a large group of friend and family over. The outside of the turkey is encrusted with a baked-on pepper rub. Inside, the meat is juicy and tender.
5012664~Slow-Cooker Asparagus and Zucchini Frittata~1845~56~30~116~135~3989~650~The beauty of oven omelets and frittatas is that they need no crust (unlike a quiche). Fortunately, the slow cooker does this job well—the eggs stay moist and tender thanks to the steady, low temperature. Be ready to serve and eat the frittata as soon as it is done cooking; for the best texture and flavor, do not let it stand on keep warm. The frittata needs maximum surface area to cook, so it works best in a large oval slow cooker. Serve with fried potatoes, or fruit salad and ciabatta toast.
5012665~Turnip Soup with Turnip Greens~1894~222~160~44~90~3261~271~People often think of turnip soup as bitter and thin, but this one, made with young delicate turnips, is creamy and sweet. Blanching the turnips first removes any bitterness, and the sharpness of the greens makes a delicious counterpoint to the sweetness of the turnips.
5014565~Wilted Autumn Greens with Honey Mustard Vinaigrette~2229~158~74~74~134~4384~257~This is a perfect autumn salad: not so much cooked as wilted greens in a warm, savory-sweet vinaigrette. Here in the South, we are lucky to have so many different greens that grow remarkably well virtually all year round. From the traditional collards, spinach, mustard, and turnip greens to the international varieties that have recently made their way here, including bok choy, tatsoi, and komatsuna, there are a variety of tastes and textures to choose from. No matter where you live, experiment with seasonal greens until you find your favorites. If you're shopping at the farmers' market, most of the vendors will be happy to let you have a few nibbles for taste-testing. The same goes for the squash—you can use butternut, acorn, pumpkin, African, or any similar variety. At Summerland Farm, we are lucky to have American chestnut trees planted by my ancestors, and even luckier that those trees survived the chestnut blight that killed most American chestnuts in the first half of the twentieth century. Fresh chestnuts—often grown in California—are available in many natural foods stores in the cooler months. If you can't find chestnuts, hazelnuts or cashews would make a good substitute.
5012668~Mixed-Pepper Steak with Onions~740~52~7~2~54~2646~0~Highly recommended!
5012670~Littleneck Clams with New Potatoes and Spring Onions~3459~623~100~421~100~32085~802~New potatoes are freshly dug and have tender skins; wash them gently so that they don't tear. If they're hard to find, any small potato or fingerling variety will work.
5012671~Barbecued Shrimp~1280~0~0~288~16~3050~2642~Highly recommended!
5012674~Lemon Custard with Raspberry Sauce~1059~118~105~43~41~1086~483~A hint of lemon is perfect in a creamy baked custard. This one has no caramel to get in the way of the lemon flavor. Lemon juice would be too overpowering here. Instead, the subtle lemon flavor comes from steeping lemon zest in the milk for the custard mixture. The heat of the milk extracts the essential oil from the lemon zest skin, and the milk absorbs the delicate flavor. The hints of cinnamon and vanilla are there to support the lemon, not obscure it. Raspberry sauce makes a perfect complement. I wouldn't dream of serving the custard without it.
5012676~Goat Cheese and Herb Dip~952~13~9~41~89~1229~160~Pâte de Fromage de Chèvre aux Herbes Fraîches
5012677~Baked Halibut with Chopped Olive Salad~1033~11~7~0~110~656~0~The flavorful olive salad is also nice with sea bass, red snapper or tuna. Serve with steamed new potatoes, and uncork a Sauvignon Blanc to go with dinner.
5012678~Herb-Stuffed Chicken with Caramelized Onion, Lentil, and Feta Salad~382~28~9~19~16~2076~45~Highly recommended!
5012679~Spiced Beef Stew with Carrots and Mint~1520~160~78~126~97~38324~255~This North African-inspired stew is good over couscous with a little lemon juice and chopped mint. Because it's made with beef tenderloin, it's ready in minutes instead of hours.
5012680~Cassoulet Soup~489~48~7~19~24~3078~61~Duck, turkey or dark chicken meat can substitute for the goose with equally delicious results. Fine accompaniments are a green salad with Roquefort vinaigrette and hot crusty bread. For a quick and sophisticated dessert, add a bit of red wine and ground cinnamon to canned pears with their syrup.
5012681~Spinach Herb Sauce~1585~26~7~4~168~1684~257~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012683~Curried Lentil and Spinach Soup~802~111~45~7~39~4112~4~Highly recommended!

5012685~Celery Root and Apple Salad with Hazelnut Vinaigrette~1539~94~21~7~117~1999~0~Highly recommended!
5012686~Roasted Chayote and Red Pepper Salad with Tangerine Dressing~252~27~15~5~12~439~10~Highly recommended!
5012687~Curried Potato, Spinach and Garbanzo Bean Soup~1283~209~47~20~42~7575~0~Basmati-rice pilaf studded with peas and carrots is ideal on the side with this mild curried soup. Have chutney, yogurt and warm pita bread as additional accompaniments. Slice fresh bananas atop papaya or mango sorbet for a refreshing dessert.
5012688~Grilled Tuna with Tarragon Mayonnaise~1494~6~5~9~165~197~4~Pour a nice Gamay to enjoy alongside.
5012689~Chicken Divan~1397~39~3~74~110~2990~360~Highly recommended!
5012691~Eggplant, Green Olive, and Provolone Pizza~1483~74~0~53~76~4971~99~Good, cheesy pizza generally doesn't need much help in the flavor department, but a grilled pie has a smoky dimension (here amplified by meaty grilled eggplant) that always leaves people clamoring for more.
5012692~Coriander Noodles with Zucchini and Carrots~1494~139~34~29~91~4231~54~Highly recommended!
5012693~Chicken Mole with Chipotles~476~30~21~19~31~1790~94~Mole, a classic Mexican chili sauce, gets streamlined here. Chipotle chilies (available canned at Latin American markets and many supermarkets) add heat, while unsweetened chocolate provides subtle sweetness. Serve the stew in shallow bowls with steamed rice. Add an arugula, orange, and red onion salad and a basket of warm corn tortillas. For dessert, offer cinnamon-spiked hot chocolate and wafer cookies.
5012694~Italian Chicken Soup~2422~282~90~138~88~5005~278~Highly recommended!
5012695~Lobster Bisque~1543~179~90~19~98~3956~157~Highly recommended!
5012696~Dark Chocolate Pretzel Cake~4257~524~271~60~251~6638~681~Highly recommended!
5012697~Broccoli Rabe with Pine Nuts and Raisins~856~87~36~8~54~0~0~With its slight bitterness, broccoli rabe takes well to assertive flavors. The classic Italian recipe calls for sautéing it with plenty of garlic and crushed red pepper flakes. But for Thanksgiving we've opted for something mellower, choosing sweet raisins, pine nuts, and a bit of sherry.
5012699~Brined Pork Chops~1160~92~59~0~84~23638~0~Highly recommended!
5012700~Corn, Cheese, and Chili Tamales with Tomatillo-Avocado Salsa~4046~481~60~226~334~11688~948~Poblano chilies (fresh green chilies), tomatillos (green tomato-like fruits), dried corn husks, and Masa Harina are found at many supermarkets and Latin American markets.
5012701~Creamy Strawberry Rice Pudding~1298~251~58~30~15~1442~56~Highly recommended!
5012702~Seared Bass with Cauliflower Duo~1056~7~5~1~118~25~0~Nutty fried cauliflower florets plus raw shavings of the vegetable's stem give flaky striped bass more complexity (and panache) than the usual fish with lemon.
5012703~Sweet, Tart, and Spicy Shrimp and Cucumber Salad~2619~178~56~187~148~14322~880~A satisfying first-course salad with beautifully balanced Asian flavors.
5012704~Orange Chicken~1562~200~120~106~25~5506~204~Highly recommended!
5012706~Onion, Parsley, and Fontina Lasagna~3606~280~172~160~213~2714~562~Highly recommended!
5012707~Skirt Steak Fajitas with Lime and Black Pepper~667~62~9~9~42~3458~0~Highly recommended!
5012708~Duck Egg Cake with Rosemary~3496~455~178~56~158~1747~994~This is an insanely easy cake to make. It goes together in just minutes and tastes awesome: a touch ducky—more so if you use wild duck fat—sweet, but not overly so, with a little hit of rosemary to even things out. I originally made this as a sort of stunt, but it's so good I've put it into the regular rotation.
5012709~Roasted Apricot Sorbet~679~180~180~0~0~1~0~Highly recommended!
5012710~Chocolate-Orange Carrot Cake~11283~1491~878~102~549~7436~689~Intense chocolate flavor accented with orange highlights this lovely layer cake.
5012711~Fresh Ricotta and Fava Bean Bruschetta~761~138~3~27~4~2001~9~Slightly sweet, fresh ricotta, which can be found in many Italian markets, makes this starter especially delicious. Regular ricotta also works well.
5012853~Meyer Lemon Shortcakes with Meyer Curd and Mixed Citrus~3834~420~115~62~207~3734~1052~"In this modern take on shortcake, the biscuits are filled with lemon curd, a ""marmalade"" made of a mixture of cooked and fresh fruit, and a spoonful of whipped cream. Keep in mind that the lemon curd needs to chill overnight."
5012715~Chicken Breasts with Goat Cheese and Rosemary~406~8~5~33~25~1206~125~Highly recommended!
5012716~Broiled Chicken with Bacon Over Egg Fried Rice~2372~300~5~88~86~2037~218~A hot skillet and an egg will quickly enliven any leftover rice parked in your refrigerator. Add meaty pieces of broiled chicken and bacon for a satisfying, inexpensive meal.
5012717~Pink Gin Spritzer~451~97~93~4~0~391~0~Highly recommended!
5012718~Caramelized-Honey Nut and Seed Tart~4359~483~258~152~274~5473~208~Yes, a press-in crust is easier to make and handle than a buttery dough that you have to roll out, but there's still some technique to doing it correctly.
5012719~Spaghetti with Creamy Sun-Dried Tomato Sauce~1517~172~16~52~57~5631~115~Active time: 35 min Start to finish: 40 min
5012720~Asparagus with Walnut-Chive Vinaigrette~1053~66~23~42~82~0~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012721~Pecan Shortbread Cookies~1672~290~118~76~78~1938~214~Highly recommended!
5012722~Fresh Indian Cheese~2176~276~256~78~78~2365~283~Paneer
5012725~New England Boiled Dinner~4794~565~221~167~198~15425~339~Highly recommended!
5012726~Cream Tart with Oranges, Honey, and Toasted-Almond Crust~3042~343~162~83~151~2665~233~This simple tart has a creamy filling and an easy press-in crust.
5012728~Chocolate-Pecan Sheet Pie With Molasses~10420~1427~907~277~602~10319~1081~The pleasant, earthy bitterness of molasses balances a typically too-sweet pecan pie filling for this thin sheet pie. A creamy chocolate ganache and crunchy candied pecans add extra texture and richness to this updated, shareable version of the classic Thanksgiving dessert.
5012729~Coconut Tarts with Prickly Pear Sauce~6158~790~496~84~306~1273~557~Reducing a mixture of coconut liquid, cream, and sugar on the stovetop creates a wonderfully creamy filling, almost like a dulce de leche. Handfuls of fresh shredded coconut give the tarts a tropical flavor, accented beautifully by the fruitiness of prickly pears.
5012730~Roasted Red Pepper Harissa~1141~40~5~0~110~838~0~An extra chile for this harissa recipe will play up the heat, and if you’re feeling confident, you can customize the mix of spices as well.
5012731~Potato-Green Chile Gratin~5737~873~168~84~209~25375~629~Highly recommended!
5012732~Mango Mint Sparklers~536~125~104~2~1~163~0~"Breakfast often comes later when you're on vacation, so we figure it's okay to indulge in this refreshing Mimosa alternative. It's important to use pure mango nectar here (though it may not be labeled ""pure""); nectar mixed with other fruit juices or high-fructose corn syrup makes the drink too sweet."
5012733~Halibut Steamed with Oranges, Tomatoes, and Olives~1321~113~53~39~59~2403~77~The fish steams directly atop the gently simmering vegetables in this flavorful and very easy dish. Serve with steamed rice tossed with lots of chopped fresh cilantro.
5012734~California Vegetable and Chickpea Chili~1347~67~22~4~118~2398~0~Only native Californians like two wine-making friends of mine in Salinas can regularly throw together a vegetable chili such as this utilizing their almost year-round abundance of fresh vegetables and herbs. For those of us with seasonal gardens, various substitutions often have to be made (canned tomatoes, dried herbs, and the like), but such is the availability almost everywhere today of certain fresh produce even in the coldest months that no imaginative cook should have much trouble concocting a very tasty vegetable and bean chili according to this basic recipe. One advantage, by the way, of using a 28-ounce can of tomatoes with their juices instead of the fresh is that most likely you won't have to add any water to keep the chili slightly soupy.
5012736~Corned Beef with Horseradish Mustard Sauce~29~0~0~0~0~975~0~Highly recommended!
5012737~Veal with Leek and Roquefort Sauce~2633~205~90~20~179~1276~501~In this elegant entrée, the leeks mellow to lend a bit of sweetness to the sauce.
5012738~Turkey Breast Roulade with Green Chiles and Feta~2344~67~6~90~179~6980~291~Highly recommended!
5012739~Greek Yogurt Cheesecake with Pomegranate Syrup~6817~789~581~90~357~4995~994~Greek yogurt lends an unexpected tanginess to this light no-bake cheesecake. Use pomegranate juice that has been flash-pasteurized (such as Pom); fresh juice can turn brown when cooked.

5012744~Savory Mint Lamb Chops~1175~101~27~21~71~4661~81~In this very simple recipe, the spices, mint, garlic, and oil form a crust that helps seal in the lamb's juices. Sautéed carrots and roasted potatoes would be nice on the side.

5012753~Bavarian Cream with Raspberry Coulis~2502~174~165~108~156~905~531~Bavarian cream is as famous as its origin is mysterious. It might have been invented by French cooks at the court of the Wittelsbacher, the powerful dynasty that ruled Bavaria for more than seven centuries until the last Bavarian king abdicated in 1918. Or possibly, it was first made by Isabeau de Bavière, daughter of a Bavarian duke who married King Charles VI of France in 1385. Whichever version you prefer, one thing is clear: Bavarian cream is deeply entrenched in history and a royal treat in the true sense of the word.
5016455~Southwestern Slaw~139~27~19~6~1~351~0~This recipe originally accompanied Baja Fish Tacos .
5012755~Triple-Chocolate Cranberry Oatmeal Cookies~6076~927~531~81~223~2082~406~Chunks of fresh cranberries and dark, milk, and white chocolate chips dress up oatmeal cookies for the holidays.

5017065~Chilled Tarragon Tomato Soup with Vegetable Confetti~517~88~66~13~8~399~26~Highly recommended!
5012768~Tequila and Lime Chicken Tacos~1630~145~61~130~55~1754~606~This dish is made with chicken thighs, which have more flavor than chicken breasts but you can substitute chicken breasts if you like. The meat needs to be raw for this dish so it can absorb more of the flavor as it cooks. Although the recipe calls for tequila, you can substitute beer, orange juice, or pineapple juice if you prefer. The liquid smoke is optional, but it does add a nice extra kick of smoky flavor. Serve this dish with rice, refried beans, and frozen margaritas or a frosty glass of beer.
5012769~To Make Lobster Stock~497~52~11~1~30~966~0~Highly recommended!
5014592~Greek-Style Shrimp~730~11~5~72~48~1651~660~We took the feta cheese out of this classic dish and stirred it into the rice that accompanies it, for a yummy variation. A cucumber salad is the perfect partner. Buy your favorite cookies for dessert.
5012771~Goat Cheese-Stuffed Turkey Burgers with Roasted Red Pepper Relish~2203~283~121~100~71~4651~293~The goat cheese and relish keep these burgers especially moist. For a nice variation, omit the goat cheese, and top the turkey burgers with sliced Havarti or Monterey Jack cheese during the last few minutes of cooking. Set out bowls of pickles and olives, and pour chilled Chardonnay throughout the meal.
5019497~Fruit Salad with Poppy Seed Dressing~323~39~23~3~16~304~0~Highly recommended!
5012774~Rosemary-Balsamic Onions~289~10~7~1~27~525~0~Highly recommended!
5012775~Stuffed Artichokes~7331~515~11~251~474~11337~482~A bit of soppressata and cheese stuffed ingeniously between each leaf gives these artichokes a heartiness worthy of a special course. (Eat them as you normally would, scraping the leaf with your teeth—but in this case you'll get a mouthful of flavor-packed filling, too.) Using a pressure cooker speeds up cooking time and also results in incredibly tender artichokes.
5012776~Grilled Italian Sausages~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~Sweet and hot Italian sausages are delicious grilled over charcoal.
5012777~Grand Marnier Souffles with Crème Anglaise~1413~129~125~25~85~626~250~Highly recommended!

5012784~"Sunflower Seed ""Risotto"" With Squash and Mushrooms"~7862~405~54~315~564~105316~0~To mimic a traditional risotto, this grain-free version first simmers sunflower seeds to soften them to a rice-like texture, then purées a portion of them to create a creamy sauce. You can easily follow the sunflower cooking method for a basic go-to grain-free risotto, then swap in whatever seasonal vegetables you'd like to top it with.
5012785~Skewered Honey-Glazed Scallops with Peach Salsa~492~76~25~25~5~2219~31~The salsa is also delicious made with diced ripe mangoes.

5012787~The Dandy Lion~224~17~17~6~7~649~26~Stephen Cole, bartender at The Barrelhouse Flat in Chicago, created this dressed-up take on the classic gin and tonic for our story Spring Cocktails Perfect for Brunch. While you should feel free to use your favorite gin, for this absinthe-laced cocktail, Cole suggests trying Hayman's Old Tom Gin, which is slightly sweeter than more traditional English dry gin.

5012801~White Bean, Kale and Roasted Vegetable Soup~4098~473~16~350~24~282152~0~Many dark, leafy greens, like kale, contain calcium. The beans have it, too.
5012802~Salmon and Smoked Salmon Rolls with Dill Sauce~3844~87~24~134~340~5757~834~This looks like sushi, but it's really a new way to present the familiar Passover fish course.
5012803~Sliced Steak with Arugula~262~52~12~0~0~1958~0~Straccetti di Manzo
5012804~Rhubarb Ginger Cooler~1596~414~414~0~0~0~0~To call this bracing pink drink a rhubarb-infused ginger ale doesn't do it justice; it's much less syrupy-sweet and more cooling. The slightly tart flavor of rhubarb pairs well with lush picnic dishes.
5012805~Fried Squid with Aïoli~13501~178~14~105~1460~8136~375~Highly recommended!
5018950~Roast Pork Tenderloin with Creamed Corn and Apple-Raisin Chutney~9791~1255~71~168~454~5148~687~"Tonya Morrison of Lewis Center, Ohio, writes: ""My husband and I had a wonderful time on our vacation to Kiawah Island, South Carolina. One night we had dinner at Rosebank Farms Café in Bohicket Marina Village. The recipe for their roast pork tenderloin with apple and raisin chutney would make a delicious souvenir."""
5012807~Stuffed Turkey with Lemon, Oregano, and Red Onions~1843~37~16~51~156~2072~356~The ingredients here evolved from the Miraglia family's favorite way to roast capon, but the simplicity of this dish will resonate with anyone looking for a beautiful and delicious all-American turkey.
5012808~Hazelnut Panforte~6699~1060~793~74~253~2276~134~"A prized Christmas sweet from Tuscany, panforte means ""strong bread"" — but it's more like an almost-flourless fruitcake."
5012809~Apricot Almond Linzertorte~5347~515~276~154~339~2874~218~For dessert, Grimes was inspired by something from Vienna, a little farther along the Danube: linzertorte. It's traditionally made with hazelnuts and raspberry jam, but this version, with its warmly spiced almond pastry and vivid apricot filling, spoke to Grimes of the highly polished coffeehouses in that part of the world. Cooking dried apricots with brandy and sugar allows you to control the sweetness quotient, and the result is all about the magically musky, tangy fruit.
5012810~Warm Pumpkin Salad with Polenta and Candied Pumpkin Seeds~3725~316~20~114~222~7068~180~Active time: 1 3/4 hr Start to finish: 5 hr
5012811~Egg Noodles with Brown Butter and Feta~1253~17~0~0~125~1140~214~This dish is wonderful no matter what egg pasta you use. And the Greek feta can be found at most supermarkets.
5017179~Mâitre d'Hôtel Butter~845~0~0~0~92~969~253~"""Compound butters are a terrific blank canvas,"" O'Connell says. ""You can mix in all sorts of flavors—anchovies, capers, any herb or spice."""
5012813~Ditalini Risotto~2950~358~68~108~107~7868~199~Rather than being cooked in salted water, the pasta is treated like risotto—simmered in stock and stirred until cooked and creamy—which gives it plenty of time to pick up meaty flavors.
5012814~Steak and Eggs Korean Style~1485~282~45~30~17~4231~370~The steaks need to marinate overnight.
5012815~Scrambled Eggs with Onions and Smoked Salmon~570~23~10~24~42~3465~468~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012816~Fettuccine With Brussels Sprouts and Pine Nuts~1589~163~9~45~89~133~333~The natural nuttiness of Brussels sprouts is greatly enhanced by the addition of pine nuts, and sautéing the sprouts deepens that flavor. Tossing them with al dente fettuccine will make you wonder how anyone could dislike them.
5012817~Meatballs in Tomato-Serrano Chile Sauce~3183~252~50~129~172~10272~646~Albóndigas con Salsa de Tomate y Chile de Serrano

5012821~BBQ Beef Brisket~1482~337~309~3~0~15020~0~"Beef brisket is one of the hardest meats to cook correctly. In Texas, this dish is a benchmark for how good a cook or restaurant is, and everyone has an opinion about how to do it right. Good food takes time, and this recipe will help you through the pitfalls of cooking a brisket. Don't ever steam your beef; it dries the meat and makes it tough. Applying a dry rub is important with large cuts of meat. Our BBQ Beef Coffee Cure is a select mixture of seasonings paired with an earthy dark-roasted ground coffee that complements the brisket. The salt and sugars in the rub will cure the outer portion of the brisket, leaving a hearty flavor and the smoke, charred crust called ""bark."""
5012822~Miso-Marinated Cod with Balsamic Vinegar and Grapefruit~1408~95~91~0~110~630~0~This entrée from Anzu restaurant in Dallas partners Japanese miso and sake with Italian balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

5012830~Jenga Ribs~395~20~19~17~20~6525~54~Bonus points for serving one huge stack and making your family get all Jenga on it for seconds.
5012831~Jerked Shrimp with Melon Salsa~1320~232~184~22~42~1834~194~A lightly dressed salad of baby greens would complement this entrée nicely; serve rum-drizzled grilled pound cake slices afterward.
5012832~Cardamom Rice Pudding (Payasam)~3362~519~463~77~117~2404~170~This is the South Indian equivalent of cake: essential at every wedding, birthday, and holiday. Indians like to serve it warm and soupy. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.
5012833~Salmon Tournedos with Herb Sauce~1421~51~3~7~111~3612~283~This entrée from Chateau Lake Louise at Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, would be perfect for a dinner party. The fish is especially good accompanied by broiled red onion slices and steamed asparagus. To make this even easier, have the salmon skinned and boned at the fish market.
5012834~Linguine with Gorgonzola, Prosciutto, and Spinach Caffè Phoenix~4952~392~11~165~426~6208~240~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012835~Butternut Squash Lasagna Rolls~2244~133~33~152~124~5089~427~I have such fond memories of helping my mom make lasagna as a kid. I was in charge of layering the noodles, sauce, ricotta and mozzarella. Today, my lasagna is a bit lighter than my mom's. Rather than making it as a large tray, I prefer to make them into rolls—which I load up with vegetables—for better portion control. And here I swap tomato sauce for a wonderfully savory Butternut squash sauce with shallots, garlic, and Parmesan cheese.
5012836~Apple-Prune Crisp with Hazelnut Topping~2847~332~110~46~143~498~126~Oregon's Willamette Valley produces great wines — as well as prunes, hazelnuts, and apples, which combine in this dessert.
5012838~Steamed Fiddleheads with Horseradish Scallion Sauce~980~22~8~16~96~1447~161~Highly recommended!
5012839~Pork Fricassée with Mushrooms and Carrots~7300~68~16~470~560~31122~2228~Highly recommended!
5012840~White Bean Soup with Duck Confit~1077~130~23~30~44~5574~0~Evocative of cassoulet but so much easier, this bean soup manages to be both rugged and elegant. No part of the confit duck legs goes to waste: The bones add savor to the beans, the meat goes into the soup, and the crisped skin makes a delectable garnish. Flambéing the Armagnac before adding it to the pot takes the edge off the alcohol while leaving behind the deep flavor of the barrel.
5012841~Hummus & Curried Cauliflower Tartine~4145~86~7~63~391~1844~71~Roasting cauliflower with spices brings out the very best in this vegetable—the golden, crispy florets are irresistible. Like broccoli, cauliflower contains compounds that may help fight damaging toxins.
5012843~Estouffade de Noël~6569~533~219~208~396~25062~679~Highly recommended!
5012844~Savoy Cabbage and Radicchio Slaw with Blood Orange Dressing~1671~173~121~11~105~1063~63~Blood orange juice gives the dressing great flavor and color. If you can't find it, use 1/2 cup pomegranate juice mixed with 1/4 cup regular orange juice.
5012845~Sauted Scallops with Cherry Tomatoes, Green Onions, and Parsley~1134~32~11~109~60~1084~211~Highly recommended!

5012849~Clams with Andouille Sausage~1968~132~12~61~129~4009~422~The heat of poblano chiles can vary dramatically. Season to taste by adjusting the amount of crushed red pepper before adding the clams.

5012852~Lime-Cilantro Yogurt Sauce~446~56~44~23~11~1218~58~This dressing can also be used as a refreshing condiment for spicy curries.
5012854~Boiled Lobster Dinner with Sesame Mayonnaise~573~111~62~11~5~519~0~This one-pot meal—lobster, corn, and green beans—conjures summer in New England. The simple sesame mayonnaise is outstanding for dunking and slathering.
5012855~Velvet Chicken with Mushrooms, Spinach, and Ginger-Lemon Sauce~755~89~17~101~31~3166~242~Offer either brown or white rice and Asian beer, like Tsingtao. The chicken is especially tender because of the egg white and cornstarch coating.
5012856~Tomato Water Bloody Mary~1448~300~287~5~30~43505~0~This drink was featured as a Cocktail of the Month.
5012858~Cinnamon and Clove Cranberry Sauce~19~2~2~0~0~0~0~The warm spices in this version are the very essence of the holiday.
5012859~Chimichurri Rojo~640~33~0~0~55~969~0~Argentine Red Sauce
5012860~Bacon and Egg Sandwiches with Pickled Spring Onions~2350~128~70~53~178~5053~674~If you've ever woken up with a hangover, you know why egg sandwiches have earned their spot in the comfort-food canon. But the day-after staple can cure your dinnertime blues, too. The necessities: a runny yolk; soft, griddled bread; and something fresh to keep the fat attack in check. Once you've nailed these basics, it's about adding a few more elements for flair. This version, from Austin's Noble Sandwich Co., uses quick-pickled onions (proof that pickles make everything taste better), Sriracha mayonnaise to bring the heat (a dash of hot sauce would also do the trick), and arugula for brightness and bite. Throw some avocado on there, or sliced ripe tomato, if you're in the mood. The point is, think savory, think seasonal, and wake up to a new reality.
5012861~"Rosemary-Sage Burgers with Apple Slaw and Chive ""Mayo"""~1046~92~28~45~50~80829~100~Healthy bonus: Magnesium and folate from spinach; fiber from apples and buns; antioxidants from rosemary and sage

5012863~Creamy Fettuccine with Bacon~6419~357~21~282~398~7500~1274~Highly recommended!
5012865~Thai Spareribs~8493~473~380~565~464~11558~1470~Unlike most braises, these ribs aren't browned before they're simmered. The long, slow simmer tenderizes the meat, and the ribs get their brown, shiny exterior from a soy and brown sugar marinade. The ideal drink pairing? Ice-cold Thai beer.
5012866~Coconut-Vegetable Slaw~582~111~56~24~0~2148~0~An addictive slaw with sweetness from the fresh coconut and sneaky, creeping heat from the chiles. Be warned! This recipe is from Bad Saint, one of Bon Appétit's Hot 10, America's Best New Restaurants 2016.
5012867~Mango-Cucumber Wine Cooler~671~127~36~8~7~563~16~Steep cucumber and mango in the wine for three hours or longer for maximum flavor. Once the fruit sinks, the wine is ready.
5012868~Linguine with Tomato-Leek Sauce~1560~209~16~40~67~745~0~The mild flavor of leeks adds a nice touch to the pasta's tomato-based sauce.
5012870~Pan-Grilled Salmon on Toast with Scallion Mayonnaise~1610~78~10~113~96~1477~372~Highly recommended!
5012871~Carrot Soup with Orange and Tarragon~545~90~69~4~20~4018~31~This creamy, low-fat soup is packed with vitamins A and C.
5015019~Black Olive Aïoli~2638~40~3~9~250~1980~4~Editor's note: Serve this aïoli with Suzanne Goin's Beef Brisket with Slow-Roasted Romano Beans and Black Olive Aïoli .
5012873~Hanger Steak with Mushrooms and Red Wine Sauce~1864~47~0~69~146~4913~339~Hanger steak pairs perfectly with a hearty red wine reduction.
5012874~Shaved Cauliflower Salad~795~17~8~20~69~640~45~Thinly sliced raw cauliflower takes center stage in this salad, tossed in a bright, limey dressing and dusted with nutritional yeast.
5016043~Roasted Butternut Squash Ribbons with Arugula, Pancetta, and Hazelnut Salad~3769~396~244~51~228~2019~62~We're skipping the classic cubes in favor of tangled butternut ribbons baked into a moist flat cake for a seriously showstopping first course. Pair the squash with a mix of spicy arugula and ever-so-slightly-bitter chicory enhanced with savory pancetta and toasted hazelnuts. A sweet-tart apple vinaigrette is the final touch atop the most refreshing fall salad we've tasted in a long time.
5012877~Curried Turkey Burgers~1144~158~62~81~18~9370~163~Highly recommended!
5012878~Chinese-Style Rice~2290~518~0~48~0~0~0~P> The secret to properly cooked Chinese-style rice, whether white or brown, is to first rinse the rice and then to avoid cooking it in too much water. For fried rice, the rice should be cooked until just tender to the bite.
5012879~Pasta with White Beans, Tomatoes, and Escarole~3483~564~32~113~81~7278~0~Highly recommended!
5012880~Kreplach~3318~574~112~227~103~21260~465~"Called Jewish wontons or raviolis, kreplach are pasta dumplings, usually triangular in shape, filled with minced meat, onion-spiced potatoes, or cheese. Kreplach carries a lot of lofty symbolism; its triangular shape represents Judaism's three patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Equally lofty: the Jewish momma who can roll her kreplach dough to optimum thinness (so that, according to Sam Levenson, ""a tempting bit of their buried treasure should show through""). If the wrappers are not paper-thin, your kreplach will taste like ""craplach."" However, though we've included wrappers in this recipe, there's really no reason to knock yourself out making them. Just purchase wonton wrappers in a Chinese food store or supermarket, and making kreplach becomes a cinch. There's even a kosher brand called Nasoya, available in many supermarkets; look for it near the tofu."
5012881~Apple and Blackberry Sorbet~951~248~219~0~0~19~0~No ice cream maker is needed to make this flavorful sorbet.
5012882~Vegetarian Cassoulet~4399~838~96~104~55~2021~0~A leek, carrot, and celery mirepoix, cooked until tender with rich white beans, gets a crisp, crunchy texture and delightfully rustic flavor from a garlicky bread-crumb topping flecked with parsley.
5012883~Golden Crisp Daikon Cake with Spicy Herb Soy Sauce~2557~354~19~89~85~13527~134~Start preparing this one day before serving — it needs to chill overnight.
5019041~Grilled Marinated London Broil~323~62~23~1~0~2076~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.

5012888~Cauliflower Pizzas With Mozzarella, Kale, and Lemon~1699~114~33~88~84~2020~515~The gluten-free crust for these vegetarian pizzas is made from cauliflower that's been ground into fine crumbs and mixed with almond flour and Parmesan cheese.
5015618~Creamy Stone-Ground Grits~428~27~25~7~30~1690~91~We are always wowed by how complex in both flavor and texture hand-milled grits are compared to their supermarket counterpart, which we don't recommend for this particular recipe. Grits are best when freshly cooked, but if you're making an entire menu, you'll probably want to prepare them the day before (see cooks' note, below). We suggest storing raw grits in the refrigerator until you're ready to cook them.
5012890~Pancetta, Leek, and Goat Cheese Tartlets~2328~259~33~69~101~2933~240~What to drink: Delicate blanc de blancs Champagne pairs well with these hors d'oeuvres.
5012891~Panettone Panzanella with Pancetta and Brussels Sprouts~2553~146~91~35~205~2177~277~Panzanella is an Italian bread and tomato salad served in the summer and made with leftover crusty country loaves. In this winter version, tomatoes are replaced by brussels sprouts and apples, and the fruit-filled bread known as panettone stands in for the country loaves.
5019846~Roasted Onion, Caper, and Tarragon Sauce~930~23~6~7~93~772~298~To accompany Fillet of Beef on Garlic Croutons.
5012893~Spring Vegetable Risotto with Poached Eggs~2901~431~12~70~78~7744~475~Risotto only sounds intimidating—if you can stir, you can make it. Poaching the eggs ahead of time should quell any lingering performance anxiety.
5012894~Waiting for Wilma Pie (Chocolate Caramel Pecan Pie)~4641~670~517~54~225~2107~463~This dressed-up rendition of a classic has a supremely satisfying filling.

5012899~Spinach-Stuffed Chicken Breasts~939~23~13~23~66~3742~244~Highly recommended!
5012900~Cheesecake Ice Cream with Strawberry Sauce~2275~321~220~38~91~1018~123~The only thing better than a favorite dessert is two faves in one— without twice the calories, of course.

5012902~Pecorino-Crusted Chicken with Mushroom Salad~1534~64~6~55~117~4223~185~Marinate thinly sliced mushrooms to create a simple, fresh salad.
5012903~Zucchini-Blossom Quesadillas~1150~93~23~56~77~3155~105~Though many of us associate quesadillas with flour tortillas, in Mexico they're often made with uncooked corn tortillas that are folded in half around a filling like a turnover, then cooked on a griddle or fried. Here, we've enclosed delicate zucchini blossoms, tomatoes, onions, and Oaxacan string cheese.
5012904~Sour Cream Chocolate Cake~6878~950~646~133~343~4111~1060~The following is a moist and chocolaty cake suitable for many occasions. Use it to form the base for Tepee Birthday Cakes .

5012906~Fish Stew with Fennel and Baby Potatoes~2863~295~40~91~134~8579~295~This stew might come together quickly, but it gets plenty of backbone from fennel and white wine.
5012907~Maple-Walnut Espresso Torte~927~215~192~12~10~642~370~Highly recommended!
5012908~Baked Sea Bass with Walnut-Breadcrumb Crust and Lemon-Dill Sauce~1830~25~6~48~172~1692~122~The chef at Kristina's makes this dish with haddock; we call for sea bass, which is more readily available.
5012909~Summer Seafood Stew~5076~399~99~401~147~13775~1738~There's a lot of liquid here, so be sure to use a very large pot to prepare the stew.
5012910~Deep-Fried Masa Turnovers with Crab~1403~114~20~90~30~5651~379~Quesadillas Fritas con Jaiba
5012911~Poached Eggs in Pipérade~807~61~13~24~52~1635~411~Pipérade is a dish from the Basque region of France that features tomatoes and green peppers cooked in olive oil. Serve with: French country bread, and baby greens in a Sherry wine vinaigrette.

5012913~Chocolate and Mixed Nut Tart in Cookie Crust~8212~808~317~145~484~2606~915~The sweet, nutty filling might remind you of a pecan pie — with melted chocolate chips.
5012914~Kombu Celery~208~5~3~2~16~1076~0~The crunchy, salty, sesame-drenched celery sticks at Bar Goto in New York are so good, you’ll forget they’re made from vegetables.
5018547~Spicy Sweet-and-Sour Grilled Chicken~1298~228~186~63~22~14359~169~There are hundreds, if not thousands, of barbecue chicken recipes out there, and we've certainly had our share, so we can say with authority that this spicy sweet-and-sour grilled chicken is the best we've had to date. It's got enough heat to titillate your taste buds, but not so much that kids will steer clear. The additions of tomato paste and soy sauce provide deep, dark, low notes that keep the sauce from squealing. In other words, it's heat with harmony.
5012916~Milk Punch with Brandy and Rum~3701~453~413~41~198~1442~430~Highly recommended!
5012917~Grilled Salmon with Quick Blueberry Pan Sauce~677~115~35~1~14~519~0~The sweet-tart pan sauce is a perfect partner for a rich fish like salmon.
5012918~Pasta Shells with Prosciutto, Ricotta and Mushrooms~1569~102~14~84~88~3871~317~Highly recommended!
5012919~Pasta Salad with Melon, Pancetta, and Ricotta Salata~1245~91~3~41~84~1126~71~Like the classic combination of melon and prosciutto? Then you'll love this main-course pasta salad.
5012920~Herb-Braised Ham~1446~71~17~19~81~4600~212~When shopping for ham, be aware that smoked pork shoulder is available partially or fully cooked. This will affect the braising time (partially cooked takes about 1 hour longer). We found that blanching the ham before braising helps eliminate excessive saltiness in both the ham and the broth. Leaving the skin on the ham adds body to the resulting sauce.
5012922~Ginger and Pink Grapefruit Cheesecake~2454~470~411~21~51~40342~470~Highly recommended!
5012923~Liptauer Cheese~1804~72~48~17~151~1126~429~Liptauer gained its name from the provenance of the fresh sheep's milk cheese with which it was originally made, Lipto, Hungary. Our version of this seasoned spread is made with cream cheese.
5012924~Mustard-Glazed Baby Carrots~501~44~33~5~23~2749~63~The carrots' natural sweetness plays off the tang of the mustard. This effortless dish pairs particularly well with the rosemary pork chop.
5012925~Muffuletta Spread~1920~25~4~0~141~2222~0~This combination of black and green olives, onion and garlic is a rendition of the relish served on the classic New Orleans sandwich called muffuletta from the Palladio restaurant in the Hyatt Regency in Rochester, New York.
5012926~Cumin-Crusted Lamb with Apricots~755~189~83~7~0~188~0~These flavors and aromas transport me to Marrakesh, where our friend Latif, son of the late imam of the great mosque there, guided us through the bustling and mysterious spice markets. Here's how I've recaptured the memory: a boned leg of lamb is stuffed with intensely flavored dried apricots, high in beta-carotene and potassium, then rubbed with aromatic cumin. Buy your cumin from a Middle Eastern market or spice store for the most flavorful results.
5012927~Pretzel-Crusted Pork Chops with Orange-Mustard Sauce~5518~648~192~89~261~7395~1238~Crushed pretzels make a better-than-breadcrumb crust.
5012929~Grilled Spiced Garlic Skirt Steak~45~1~1~0~4~23750~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012930~Enchiladas Verdes (Green Chicken Enchiladas)~4379~455~36~108~217~8897~236~Typical Mexican enchiladas arrive rolled up and stuffed, but at my favorite enchilada street stand—the inspiration for this recipe—they're stacked in a messy, luxurious pile, with separate individual layers of corn tortillas, fresh cilantro and onion, green enchilada sauce, shredded cheese and chicken. The whole thing is topped with a blanket of crema and more cheese. It's almost like a deconstructed lasagna. The dish is enough to make you fall deeply in love with Mexico City—particularly when the corn tortillas are homemade, and the green sauce is prepared with a slow-simmering pot of fresh chicken stock.
5012931~Barbecue Turkey Sandwiches~911~157~43~39~11~3545~68~These are especially good when made with leftover grilled turkey.
5012932~Saucy Snapper with Bay Shrimp~872~55~9~19~59~1654~140~With steamed asparagus and some rice or mashed potatoes, this easy dish is elegant enough for company.
5012933~The Last Word~59~0~0~0~0~0~0~"Bartender Chris Hannah's creation is all about balance: He blends gin and herbaceous Chartreuse with maraschino liqueur, adding a splash of lime for brightness. We can't say if it's the ""last word"" on cocktails, as its name claims it to be, but you won't hear any complaints about it."
5012934~Confit of Winter Fruits~2580~563~370~13~32~4675~1~The acidity of the vinegar and grapefruit is balanced by the quince, apple, and pear flavors in this French-style chutney. Bananas add creaminess. Use ripe fruit for best results.
5012935~Chocolate Egg Cream~264~51~43~4~3~196~14~Many years ago, this delicious New York fountain drink was actually made with eggs, but it's been a long time since anyone's seen that version. If you are a serious egg cream lover, use a seltzer siphon to get the best foam.
5012937~Butternut Squash Flan with Parmesan Sage Sauce~1836~164~41~67~100~1288~688~Highly recommended!
5012938~Parmesan Mustard Chicken Wings~2224~181~11~79~123~2042~387~Highly recommended!

5012940~Garlic Rosemary Bagel Crisps~1230~58~8~7~112~30061~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012941~Farmers Market Salad with Aged Gouda and Roasted Portabellas~1780~22~0~52~177~2971~144~Lobes of golden mushrooms, shreds of buttery Gouda cheese, and the heartiness of spicy greens come together in this substantial salad. It's a terrific companion to the chive shortcakes, stew, and baked tomatoes, but keep it in mind when all you're after is a soup-and-salad supper.
5012942~Roasted Tomato and Bell Pepper Salsa~578~74~12~10~24~3001~0~Active time: 15 min Start to finish: 30 min

5012944~Roasted Turkey Breast with Balsamic Glaze and Bell Pepper-Onion Sauté~767~114~31~9~30~2640~0~Highly recommended!
5012945~Baked Scallops with Herbed Breadcrumb Topping~673~41~0~56~25~1053~167~Orzo pilaf and stewed tomatoes simmered with sliced fennel bulb are nice side dishes. Classic chocolate mousse is the perfect finish.
5014471~Green Beans with Ginger and Cashews~2442~176~26~78~157~3897~126~Even if you're a fan of the traditional green bean casserole, you might want to consider subbing these simply prepared fresh beans, which can provide balance to all the rich items on the menu. Plus, this streamlined dish, which needs just a brief rewarming on top of the stove before serving, won't contribute to a last-minute traffic jam in the oven.
5012947~Basmati Rice with Raisins, Nuts and Peas~3687~569~155~67~107~2673~78~From India's restaurant in Denver, this side dish has whole peppercorns, cardamom and cloves. They are not meant to be eaten, so discard them when serving the rice.
5012948~Roasted Fennel with Olives and Garlic~935~33~0~0~55~0~0~Roasting brings out fennel's sweet side.
5012949~Braised Short Ribs with Carrots and Onions~979~108~52~18~28~4726~1~Smoked salmon and horseradish cream atop toast points with flutes of sparkling brut rosé make a sophisticated starter for this dinner. The meaty short ribs smothered with a succulent sauce team up perfectly with the Crispy Garlic Risotto Cakes and a simple sauté of red bell peppers and zucchini. Pour a robust Zinfandel to go with it all. Begin preparing this recipe a day ahead. Follow with a warm apple tart and ice cream for dessert.
5012951~Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwiches~1012~128~47~27~52~569~0~Highly recommended!
5012953~Asian Chicken and Water Chestnut Patties~1195~67~15~142~37~6464~343~"Serve these patties over <epi:recipelink id=""106530"""">gingered noodle salad</epi:recipelink>."

5012957~Mustard-Roasted Salmon with Lingonberry Sauce~356~24~21~0~23~719~63~Cranberry sauce or huckleberry preserves can be substituted for the lingonberry preserves. Serve with: Roasted fingerling potatoes tossed with dill, and a mixed green salad.
5012958~Chilled Minted Cucumber Honeydew Soup~867~205~144~11~0~232~8~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less, but requires additional unattended time.
5012959~Wood-Smoked Tri-Tip with Sicilian Herb Sauce~1258~36~3~17~117~2874~60~The simple herb, lemon, and garlic sauce is called salmoriglio in Sicily.
5012960~Korean-Style Noodles with Vegetables~1488~196~56~51~62~8964~0~Chap Chae
5012961~Thai Green Curry with Seafood~3252~492~40~194~47~8576~716~When the topic of chowder comes up, debates rage about the merits of the creamy New England style versus the red, tomato-packed Manhattan version. We'd be hard-pressed to choose a favorite, but one thing is for sure: We love chowder. It's comforting, hearty, and full of seafood. The same can be said of Thai-style seafood curry. Coconut milk stands in for cream, and curry paste packs a warming punch. Its global chowder— and it's delicious. That's something we can all agree on.
5012962~Honeyed Chestnut Corn Bread~5198~712~130~106~133~5977~623~Serve with additional honey, if desired.
5012963~Garlic Mojo Hot Dogs~1256~141~23~28~73~962~0~Mojo is a Cuban sauce made from the juice of sour oranges (or, in this case, a mix of orange juice and lime juice). It's truly versatile—the sauce works as a marinade or salsa for beef, fish, pork, and poultry—so no wonder it tastes great with hot dogs, too.
5012964~Tapioca with Stewed Apples and Apricots~2173~406~217~14~46~622~326~Tapioca, like semolina, is one of those things that a school kitchen could have turned you off for life. I couldn't eat it for years, having been force-fed it at primary school aged six, with tinned jam, as it oozed like frogspawn out of the bowl and I wept and retched. For years I had the same malicious feeling toward beets and mashed potatoes, which were instant and came in lumpy granules. My teacher and I had a silent war every lunchtime; a war that eventually came to an end after my parents removed me from the school. Made to your own wont, in your own kitchen, tapioca is ambrosial, and worth being a grown-up for, as is semolina. This could also be a pudding, not a breakfast, just don't serve it with dog foodlike tinned jam. Try a lovely homemade compote instead.
5012965~Mâche, Frisée, and Radish Salad with Mustard Vinaigrette~105~21~12~3~0~812~0~Veal in Switzerland often presupposes sauerkraut, but we prefer a lighter take. With crunchy radishes and bitter frisée, this salad brings its vinegar note in the form of a spicy mustard dressing.
5012966~Chai-Poached Apricots and Plums~1194~305~265~6~0~47~0~More elegant than jam but just as handy, this compote goes with almost everything.
5012967~Persian-Style Carrots and Black-Eyed Peas~966~138~81~26~38~3522~0~One of my favorite crops from my husband’s farm are his fall carrots. I prefer the fall carrots because as the weather gets colder the vegetable sugars concentrate, yielding the sweetest carrots of the year. We use lots of carrots in this recipe, so that it’s more about the carrots than anything else. For the best flavor, serve it cold the day after you make it. You can substitute chickpeas for the black-eyed peas, if you prefer to use another type of bean.
5012968~Kale, Potato, and Onion Frittata~2321~439~75~72~24~11936~374~All hail kale: Research shows it turns on your body's natural detoxifying enzymes to help ward off lung and stomach cancers.
5017591~Sauteed Fennel, Capers and Arugula~1155~159~31~45~36~4339~0~A lovely side dish with big flavors‑and only a single teaspoon of oil.

5012977~Lemon Tart Brûlée~1094~29~29~12~102~140~623~Highly recommended!
5012978~Cream of Cauliflower Soup~969~47~18~14~73~5519~181~Sprinkle with crystallized ginger or sliced scallions.
5012979~Ipanema Punch~3007~692~259~38~7~6732~0~All of the flavors of the tropics make an appearance in this sensational, lemon-hued punch-banana, rum, pineapple, and orange. Serve this at a BBQ featuring great pork ribs.

The cantaloupe breaks down to form the backbone of a sweet, creamy sauce scented with pancetta and marjoram. A sleeper but a keeper, for sure.
5013032~Coconut-Vegetable Curry~2222~199~60~20~141~4554~316~A flavorful, colorful vegetarian stew that's as beautiful as it is easy to make. Rice on the side makes the dish complete and soaks up all those great flavors.

5013036~Moroccan Roasted Chicken~4175~722~275~66~118~10312~0~"During the developing and testing process for this book, this dish became Hubby's new favorite. Totally unexpected—I was sure he'd steal a line from the kids and say, ""Thank you anyway, but this is not my taste."" (We taught them to say that instead of ""Ooo, yick!"") It's just not the usual stuff and spices he goes for, but apparently the combination was soooo his taste. And mine, too. It's one of those winner recipes that will make you dance around your kitchen. You may hug me now."
5013037~Chewy Almond-Raspberry Sandwich Cookies~3105~296~249~85~194~1200~2~These pretty cookies are a cross between an almond horse shoe cookie and a Linzer cookie. Blackberry or apricot jam would also be delicious.

Here, pork's natural sweetness is coaxed forward by the herbs and onions in the stuffing. And the crispy, savory bones are a delightful bonus. You will have to special-order this cut of meat (the rib portions of the loins are joined to form a circle) from your butcher.
5013044~Banana, Raisin, and Oatmeal Pancakes~3515~624~242~80~75~1891~524~These are great with maple syrup, honey, marmalade, or even cottage cheese.

5013061~Pink Grapefruit, Avocado, and Watercress Salad~1540~60~15~13~137~754~0~This elegant, light salad is ideal to serve as a first course. Pink grapefruit and peppery watercress cut the richness of avocado, and a scattering of toasted hazelnuts and hazelnut oil in the dressing suggest a flavor of early fall. Prosciutto is a graceful inclusion, but you can leave it out for a lighter vegetarian salad if you like.
5013062~Boneless Leg of Lamb Stuffed with Swiss Chard and Feta~2531~147~39~106~164~28373~238~Highly recommended!

The recipe makes an extra gingerbread cake; have it for breakfast the next morning. If you prefer to make 12 individual trifles, use all three gingerbread cakes and cut each in half horizontally. Using a pretty glass as a guide, cut out 4 cake rounds from each cut cake layer. Alternate 2 cake rounds with 2 to 3 layers of the mascarpone cream, a few candied kumquats, and some poached cranberries in each glass.
5013064~Down-East Succotash~702~16~9~30~53~1498~115~Highly recommended!

""When I moved here from Texas ten years ago, it was hard to leave the people I'd known for so long, but I've probably met two hundred new people since then. I have always entertained, but now that I'm retired, I finally have more time to play bridge and cook."""
5013070~Miss Milton's Lovely Fudge Pie~3354~493~421~41~147~1459~645~This is it, the decadent pie that seduced the seductive Marilyn Monroe. She simply couldn't get enough of it. Patch brought this recipe with him from Arkansas, where it was named for his sister Milton.
5013072~Watermelon and Cucumber Gazpacho~1340~155~18~25~59~3468~186~This fresh, colorful soup makes a great summer starter.
5013074~Brussels Sprouts for People Who Think They Hate Brussels Sprouts~1062~75~10~63~62~3820~118~I understand why Brussels sprouts top the list of detested vegetables for many people. When they are large, old, or overcooked, they tend to have an obnoxious, barnyardy flavor that some people are sensitive to whereas others are not. You can minimize this by choosing smaller, fresh-looking sprouts and cooking them just until they are crunchy-tender and bright colored. (Do not use frozen sprouts.) The secret of this dish is balancing ingredients to mellow the strong flavor of these miniature cabbages. Olive oil, garlic, red pepper, Parmesan, and, especially, nutmeg do the trick admirably.
5013075~Pete's Burger~3714~141~29~223~251~6336~790~There are no secrets to this burger recipe—this is simply a burger I like to cook on my grill, and then eat with a cold beer while watching the surf roll in.
5013077~Grilled Lemon Chicken and Moroccan Couscous Salad~2773~237~120~64~170~10050~62~While traditional couscous with its exotic spices is the stuff of cold winter nights, I love that the same spices—ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, and cumin—can make a cool couscous salad that's perfect on even the sultriest days. My favorite go-along is grilled chicken, but the salad is also good with grilled fish. When I've got leftover couscous, I spoon it onto a bed of lightly dressed greens, surround it with slices of tomato (and sometimes hard-boiled eggs), and call it lunch.
5013078~Chicken with Mushrooms and Bacon~1918~95~35~103~112~6055~325~Highly recommended!

5013081~Homemade Montreal Steak Seasoning~135~1~0~2~12~42~0~Why buy this classic steak rub when you can make it yourself? Inspired by the flavors of pastrami, this rub is good on more than just steaks—try rubbing it on chicken, salmon, or even broccoli before grilling or pan-roasting.

5013085~Rolled Pork Loin Roast Stuffed With Olives and Herbs~608~1~0~0~69~24945~0~Of course, you can just roast a chunk of pork loin and spoon tapenade over it, but when you stuff the tapenade inside the roast, it will look all swirled and magical when sliced. It’s not that hard to do, really—two strategic cuts, a smear, a row of knotted strings—more basic butchery than brain surgery.
5013086~Double-Baked Roquefort Potatoes~1114~81~17~45~67~3899~151~Highly recommended!
5013087~Roasted Orange Molasses Sweet Potatoes~649~158~134~4~0~1064~0~No southern holiday meal would be complete without sweet potatoes, and this simple twist on old-fashioned candied yams, with the addition of molasses and an orange's juice and zest, tastes bright and full of nuance.

5013089~Plum Clafoutis~1000~155~75~46~32~978~443~The joy of this simple dessert is that it is even better at room temperature, so you can make it in advance with ease. Be sure to pull it from the oven when the egg mixture is just set, so that the luscious cooked plum texture can meld perfectly with the batter. Think of it as a thick fruit pancake cooked effortlessly in the oven while you do other things.
5013091~Olive, Rosemary, and Onion Focaccia~2351~467~7~199~106~9593~10~Highly recommended!
5013092~Midwestern Whole Wheat Dried Fruit Stuffing~3018~609~468~34~48~3083~464~This stuffing is based on ingredients prevalent throughout the Midwest. Michigan dried cherries are often used to accent dishes in that state, while prunes, raisins and dried currants are often found in many sweet and savory recipes from Ohio and Indiana. Using only three tablespoons of butter for ten servings makes this dish low in fat, too.
5013093~Mushroom-Stuffed Pork Tenderloin with Celery Root Mashed Potatoes~3244~293~60~107~171~21756~422~At the lodge, the tenderloin is also complemented by a spicy peach salsa.

5013101~Roasted Squash with Date Relish and Pumpkin Seeds~941~197~177~22~14~433~45~Be sure to use Deglet Noor or another firm date variety; Medjool dates are too soft and sticky for this recipe.

5013108~Sabayon Lingonberry Mousse~2832~226~222~21~219~389~711~Lingonberries grow wild in forests all over Scandinavia — they have a tartness similar to cranberries but with an earthy, pinelike undertone.
5013109~Chicken with Bell Peppers and Olives~956~36~2~53~56~2693~150~Serve white rice with saffron on the side, and orange sorbet topped with chocolate shavings for dessert. Look for the herbes de Provence in the spice aisle at the market.

5015646~Broccoli Spears with Garlic Sauce~414~45~4~5~18~2492~2~Highly recommended!
5013115~Grilled Spice-Rubbed Flank Steak~198~37~4~0~0~1938~0~Highly recommended!
5013116~Argentine-Style Beef with Chimichurri Sauce~2690~132~27~309~334~5212~844~Thick, herby chimichurri is a great sauce to add to your cooking repertoire. Serve it with grilled meats or sausages, toss it with roasted potatoes, brush it on bread before grilling, or pair it with fried eggs.
5013117~Jerk Spice–Rubbed Chicken Legs~1066~120~34~18~73~1181~62~We took the traditional Jamaican jerk spice and simplified it. Before you call the authenticity police, give it a try on roast chicken legs.
5013119~Pasta with Greens, Goat Cheese and Raisins~3106~437~41~91~110~1270~111~It used to be that beets were sent to the market without the greens, which had been discarded. Now both are sold, often separately. Your best bet is to buy beets that have the greens intact; that way, you can partner this unique sweet and savory pasta with the perfect side dish: roasted fresh beets.
5013120~Tomato-Cheddar Pie~4174~350~40~89~301~12512~511~Ripe heirloom tomatoes and sharp cheddar cheese are a match made in heaven in this savory pie.
5013121~Beef Rolls with Parmesan, Pine Nuts, Olives, and Capers~1304~84~3~12~103~685~0~Involtini di Manzo

5013123~Toasted-Coconut Soufflés with Ruby-Red Cranberry Sauce~2104~444~373~12~29~358~67~Coconut milk, coconut extract, and rum give the soufflés a slightly tropical note. The vivid crimson sauce looks beautiful with the white soufflés.
5013124~Brandy Alexander II~211~15~13~0~16~11~39~This creamy alternative to eggnog gets an extra dose of richness from crème de cacao.
5013128~Southern California Crepes~4922~234~46~360~372~17098~1420~(Spicy Chicken Crêpes)
5013129~Hot and Sour Shrimp Soup (Tom Yum Kung)~920~100~70~105~13~14002~908~Tom Yum is made so many different ways that no two batches are really ever alike. Simultaneously spicy, tart, and sweet, this soup grows on you the more you eat it. Try it along with rice to cut some of the heat, or eat it throughout a meal for a welcome contrast.
5013130~Whole Grain Cranberry-Apple Scones~4208~735~258~117~43~2888~4~These are best served warm.

5013135~Pine Nut-Orange Caramel Sauce~2754~536~530~1~73~317~251~Delicious over vanilla ice cream.
5013136~Spicy Mussels in White Wine~1349~48~8~160~30~6070~534~Serve garlic toast with this to mop up all the savory broth.
5013228~To Warm Tortillas~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~Traditionally tortillas are heated a few at a time on a hot comal, or griddle, for a few seconds on either side and stacked as heated in a cloth-lined tortilla basket with a cover. The oven method we recommend here is useful for heating many tortillas at once.
5013139~Tomato and Ricotta Salata Bruschetta~1312~217~76~77~78~1786~30~Bruschetta — a rustic Italian canapé — is the perfect vehicle for the robust flavors of late summer. Serve these topped toasts as a first course or, with a salad and a glass of wine, as a light supper.
5013140~Zucchini-Cilantro Dip~1122~100~41~18~67~1641~53~Highly recommended!
5013141~Santa Fe Tortilla Pizza~436~67~0~14~11~1141~0~Sliced leftover cooked pork makes this quick pizza even quicker.
5013142~Potato and Blue Cheese Gratin~1036~50~5~1~94~1076~314~Tender, rich, and browned on top, this easy potato gratin gets loads of flavor from a very minimal amount of blue cheese that is added at the last minute.
5017883~Toasted-Almond Cookies~1834~168~120~43~124~452~218~Ultra-thin and wonderfully crisp, these cookies pack plenty of flavor into a slim package. We like to pair them with the prunes in wine or the orange tapioca pudding, but they're also wonderful on their own or with a hot cup of coffee.
5019757~Caramel Pecan Cakes~4018~768~637~71~132~2138~218~These individual cakes, from Lantern pastry chef Monica Segovia-Welsh, are moist, tender, and not remotely fussy. If you dont want to fool with the suggested accompaniments, serve the cakes with a dollop of whipped cream instead.
5013278~Sesame-Cilantro Rice~1631~292~3~33~32~0~0~Highly recommended!
5013149~Peaches and Raspberries in Ancho Syrup with Chile Threads~820~210~195~2~0~0~0~A fruity flavor and mellow heat make ancho chile — poblano chile in its dried form — a delicious and unusual addition to the sweetness of ripe peaches and raspberries.
5013150~Maple Tea Scones~4424~603~82~70~172~2426~512~Highly recommended!
5013151~Bruschetta with White Beans, Tomatoes and Olives~1891~93~7~51~128~2294~140~A terrific appetizer for parties.
5013152~Leave It to Me~289~89~3~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5014945~Roast Vermont Turkey with Giblet Gravy and Sausage and Sage Dressing, for Thanksgiving~3354~169~45~76~274~6385~535~Turkey may not have played as big a part in the first Thanksgiving, held back in 1621, as it does in our contemporary celebration. If turkey was served at all, it was probably one of many game birds, that were served along with venison, oysters, clams, lobsters, and eels, as well as succotash, beach plums, sweet potatoes, leeks and cornbread. My own Thanksgiving menu is intended to pay homage to the foods of the first Thanksgiving , as well as to the foods that have become associated with this holiday. I believe that holidays by their own nature demand that traditional foods be served. In America, there is no stronger correlation between the food and the day than that of the venerable Thanksgiving Day turkey.
5013154~Baked Tomatoes with Hazelnut Bread Crumbs~2075~97~10~31~172~16~214~A topping of buttery whole-wheat bread crumbs and hazelnuts creates a toasty counterpoint to baked thick-sliced tomatoes. What prevents it from being too rich, though, is the accent of thyme—lemon thyme in particular. With its small green leaves edged in yellow, the herb is easy to spot at the farmers market. Still not sure? Take a sniff. Lemon thyme's brisk, citrusy scent is a real eye-opener.
5013155~Pork, Beef, and Black Bean Chili~5584~460~199~288~282~53667~659~"""Last year my family spent the holidays on the Big Island of Hawaii,"" writes Jo Lucarz of Phoenix, Arizona. ""One afternoon we ate lunch in Kamuela at the Parker Ranch Grill, where we had the best chili ever — and coming from a group of Arizona natives, that's saying a lot."""
5013156~Pan-Fried Pork Chops~655~141~3~11~0~585~0~Highly recommended!
5013157~Gingerbread-Raisin Scones~2507~372~24~57~70~2425~200~Highly recommended!
5013158~Pan-Seared Fish Fillets in Ginger Broth~887~48~28~22~63~4734~63~The stacking and Asian fusion of this dish is very 1990s. But don't worry about its trendiness: Heady wallops of curry and ginger make this beautiful preparation timeless.
5013159~Fried Cardoons~12913~49~0~71~1462~900~475~Only a culture that loves food could have come up with multiple techniques for cooking the cardoon—this thistle (a cousin of the artichoke that also tastes like one) with the texture of overgrown celery requires meticulous preparation. But the fact that Italians and Italian-Americans alike scour the markets for it come fall is evidence enough that it's worth it. A light coating and deep-frying really enhance the vegetable's subtle flavor.
5013160~Rhubarb and Raspberry Jam Roly-Poly with Vanilla Custard Sauce~4087~670~306~47~120~2036~335~A roly-poly is a traditional British dessert similar to an American jelly roll. In this version, the scone-like pastry is spread with tangysweet raspberry and rhubarb jam, then baked.
5013161~Spaghetti with Cremini Mushrooms, Lemon, and Thyme~2034~115~4~44~149~2987~303~Highly recommended!

5013169~Standing Rib Roast with Rosemary-Thyme Crust~886~56~12~24~50~1862~156~An herb crust and special Zinfandel sauce give new meaning to the word flavorful. What to drink: A full-bodied, tannin-rich Bordeaux or Cabernet Sauvignon.
5013170~Pasta Primavera Pronto~3126~425~25~95~97~1791~115~Packed with springtime vegetables, this meal is a quick fix for the winter blues.
5013171~Goan Shrimp in Roasted-Coconut Sauce~1663~197~21~10~84~11718~0~This South Indian dish—also known as xec-xec—is full of tamarind, cumin, coriander, and roasted coconut. The spices meld with the tomato to form a flavorful sauce that clings to the shrimp.
5013172~Braised Fish with Fennel, Tomatoes and Olives~211~11~8~18~16~332~64~Highly recommended!
5013173~Chocolate Raisin Bread Pudding~1080~161~113~26~34~912~91~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5013174~The Retro Highball~17~4~3~0~0~7~0~Classic Highballs called for club soda and a spirit, but over the years included sweeter mixers (the gin and tonic is one such version; the Moscow Mule, another). We suggest a return to the dry version, which allows premium spirits to shine.
5013175~Yellow Bell Pepper Soup~961~98~16~19~52~4781~118~Highly recommended!
5013176~Sauteed Potatoes~7025~1345~268~134~102~40921~189~Highly recommended!
5013177~Lamb Meatballs with Escarole, Cipollini Onions, and Cranberry Beans~4242~383~258~215~215~15987~1105~Chef Tom Kearney is always trying to deliver something fresh and unexpected in a familiar package. “I love the homespun aspect of it, the familiarity of the meatballs—but they deliver the flavor of lamb,” he says. This recipe makes excellent use of all those dried herbs in your spice rack; the flavors really hold their own during the cooking process and shine through in every bite.
5013178~Paprika-Glazed Baby Back Ribs~5634~119~86~490~347~20454~1822~Highly recommended!
5013179~Vin Santo Zabaglione with Orange and Grapefruit~269~59~52~9~0~199~4~This surprisingly rich-tasting custard has much less fat than the classic version made with egg yolks. In another twist, we call for vin santo instead of the conventional choice, Marsala.
5013180~Mango, Jícama and Corn Salad~575~125~52~10~1~204~0~Here's a bright and refreshing salad. Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5013181~Crepes with Homemade Fruit Syrup~1549~318~188~71~31~592~405~Highly recommended!
5013700~Red Chili Powder~138~0~0~20~5~700~60~Highly recommended!
5013183~Summer Tomato and Bell Pepper Soup~570~65~26~4~27~2658~0~Ripe summer tomatoes are perfect just as they are. Simply chop them up, mix with jarred peppers and a few other ingredients, and you've got dinner. For a vegetarian supper, round out the meal with an assortment of cheeses and crackers. Craving something a little more substantial? A platter of smoked salmon, relishes, and breadsticks would be great with the soup. For dessert, offer figs drizzled with honey.
5013184~Southern Gin~273~86~0~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5013185~Soba Noodle Salad with Cucumber and Mango~2541~297~81~59~118~2900~0~Soba noodles can be found in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets.
5013186~Rosemary Olive Oil Bread~865~295~0~131~0~3877~0~A healthy dose of olive oil gives this rosemary-infused bread a rich, moist crumb and pale golden hue; it also helps it keep a little better than other European-style breads. Among other things, this is a wonderful and unconventional loaf for sandwiches.
5013187~Chocolate-Malt Cake~10849~1793~1156~143~318~4762~1079~Brownie-like cakes are layered with malt-fudge sauce, chocolate-malt crumbs, and charred marshmallows in this Dr. Seuss-like dessert. To help support the sweet structure, the dessert is assembled in a springform pan. Timing note: The assembled cake needs to chill overnight and has to stand at room temperature for a few hours before serving.
5013188~Ginger Pineapple Sparkling Punch~3609~1166~328~0~0~3~0~A splash of vodka or gin transforms this lively punch into a festive cocktail.
5013190~Prosciutto, Munster, and Cumin Corn-Bread Sandwiches~2118~312~53~132~52~6255~265~Highly recommended!
5013191~Cranberry-Port Conserve~1208~311~306~6~0~381~0~A conserve usually consists of a mixture of fresh fruits, often with raisins, currants or nuts added. New England seafarers prized citrus fruits, which are perfect with native cranberries.
5013192~Shrimp, Endive and Watercress Salad~695~18~11~21~45~6510~194~Highly recommended!
5013193~Passover Chremslach~1053~112~33~24~56~1054~370~This is an updated version of the chremslach passed down in my own family. I have never had a seder without it. A heavier version stuffed with cranberries appeared in many early American Jewish cookbooks as Kentucky grimslech.
5013194~Spiced Saffron Rice~1486~282~3~22~29~1967~3~Highly recommended!
5013195~Swordfish with Lime-Ginger Glaze~156~36~33~3~0~1577~0~Serve the fish with steamed rice and braised bok choy or Napa cabbage for an elegant and easy Asian-inspired dinner. Begin marinating the fish at least three hours before you plan to cook it.
5013196~Rigatoni with Cheese and Italian Sausage~1578~206~8~74~53~1709~132~At Luca this is prepared in individual dishes. For a family-style dinner, double the recipe and prepare it in one large baking dish. Use your favorite marinara recipe or a purchased sauce.
5013197~Salmon Cakes with Lemon-Herb Mayonnaise~1799~26~5~12~191~2185~319~If you don't have fresh salmon, canned salmon is a perfectly fine stand-in.
5013198~Raw Artichoke Salad, Celery, and Parmesan~754~42~9~20~55~776~45~To prevent cut artichokes from browning, work with 1 artichoke at a time and lightly toss it in the lemon dressing as you go.
5013199~Sweet-Potato Pancakes with Caviar~1046~47~16~30~89~4042~450~You can form the sweet-potato pancakes up to six hours ahead, leaving only a quick frying before serving.
5013200~Coconut and Palm Sugar Syrup with Tapioca, Tropical Fruit, and Shaved Ice~942~234~218~0~2~144~0~"Made from yuca (pronounced ""YOO-ca""), pearl tapioca can be found at Asian markets and specialty foods shops."
5013201~Mango Rum Batida~2223~686~222~12~8~336~28~Blended drinks called batidas (or licuados) are served at fruit bars throughout Latin America. Milk or freshly squeezed orange juice is used as the base, then fruit is added and the mixture is blended to the consistency of a thick shake. Batidas are often enjoyed as a mid-morning or afternoon snack, but they're also delicious as cocktails later in the day. We tried various kinds of sugar to rim the glasses — from coarse crystals of sanding sugar to small grains of granulated sugar — and the only difference is in the appearance.
5013202~Winter Greens Gratin~6554~750~79~240~279~4259~680~Blanching the mustard greens and kale ahead of time both softens them up and helps keep their color.
5013203~Zucchini Curry~1585~113~35~26~115~5721~44~Highly recommended!
5015052~Vanilla Cream~132~16~15~1~6~59~0~This recipe was created to accompany Honeydew in Cardamom Lime Syrup with Vanilla Cream.

5013206~Tuscan Panzanella~5150~668~41~127~223~9309~58~A good bread salad soaks up the juices from the tomatoes, olive oil, vinegar, and all the other seductive flavors that go into a really top-flight panzanella, and I love it! The tomatoes should be at their juicy, high-summer peak and the bread bakery-fresh, with a pleasingly soft crumb and chewy crust. My recipe not only calls for the best tomatoes and bread, but also relies on green, fruity, extra virgin olive oil, zesty red wine vinegar, salty capers, and freshly grated lemon zest. (I use a microplane when I zest citrus fruit and I highly recommend you do the same.) I also add other vegetables such as red onion, bell peppers, and fennel, garden-fresh basil, and some inky black olives for a salad bursting with summer.
5013207~Pear Croustade with Lemon Pastry and Almonds~3335~483~179~43~127~1095~331~In this free-form tart, the filling is mounded in the center of the pastry and the edges are simply folded up around it.
5013208~Classic Cabbage Kimchi~1245~246~34~108~3~52712~10~I love kimchi. To me, the world is a better place when we all enjoy kimchi. Fiery and fun, it gives a kick to all food.
5013209~Teriyaki Scallops and Green Onions~97~9~3~18~0~262~31~Try packaged Asian rice mix (or steamed white rice), and tomato and cucumber salad sprinkled with seasoned rice vinegar. To end, spoon sliced fruits over mango sorbet. Look for the horseradish paste in the Asian foods section or next to the packaged sushi.
5013210~Cherry and Plum Bruschetta~2177~365~227~42~63~1419~0~The combination of creamy ricotta, sweet fruit, rich olive oil, and a little salt is addictive. We'll be serving this for breakfast, brunch, and dessert all summer.
5013211~Chile-Garlic Shrimp~1354~44~4~195~40~2306~1771~Pop a few of these to feel lively all night long—they supply energizing iron and protein. And capsaicin, the compound that gives chiles their fire, may kick up your metabolism.

5013215~Crudités with Lemon-Garlic Aïoli~3281~201~53~33~256~7839~297~Crudités and dip are party staples. Choose whatever seasonal veggies you like, but mix up the colors. Some veggies, such as carrots and peppers, can be served raw, while others, like zucchini and asparagus, should be blanched but still have a slight crunch. There's nothing sexy about a limp piece of asparagus! And keep the vegetables separate—it makes it easier to refill the platters.
5013216~Greek Chicken Salad~2149~204~58~115~93~150246~310~Protein-packed chickpeas and feta satisfy you for hours; bell pepper offers immunity-enhancing vitamin C.
5013218~Cucumber Yum Yum Cocktail~334~73~66~0~0~0~0~At 1105, a bar in Copenhagen, juniper-inflected gin is paired with caraway-flavored aquavit, Scandinavia's traditional eau-de-vie.

5013239~Leeks Vinaigrette with Burrata Cheese and Mustard~1404~25~12~6~132~6739~0~Most burrata—cream-filled fresh mozzarella—is made in just two places: Puglia and Southern California. But this addictive cheese is catching on. Chef Nancy Silverton combines it with leeks and breadcrumbs at her (and Mario Batali's) Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles. Look for burrata at Italian delis and cheese stores.
5013241~Goat Cheese and Honey Blancmange~1282~143~119~49~59~3860~242~Studies show that sweeter-than-sugar honey has disease-fighting antioxidants. It also makes Bonaparte's unique dessert bee-licious!

The technique, learned from the original Americans, uses a steaming pit either dug in the sand or made from natural rock formations to cook a wide variety of ingredients without relying on forged pots and pans. The presentation, the most spectacular I have ever seen, is a ten-foot-tall burst of steam released upon removal of the tarp. As the steam subsides, bright red lobsters facing back to back on dark green rockweed come into view. Sweet corn surrounds the lobsters. Underneath the seaweed lie buried treasures: soft-shell clams, rock crabs, a whole fish, mussels, periwinkles, potatoes, boiling onions, sausage and hen or duck eggs. The sights and smells are intoxicating. The lobster bake, much more than a dish or even a feast, embodies a day filled with the wonders of water, fire, food, family and friends.

5013379~Breakfast Cookies~439~96~74~9~0~2878~4~"Before I had children, I swore up and down that I'd never be one of those parents kowtowing to the little picky eaters' preferences at mealtimes. And then I had actual children. I'm no parenting expert, but my personal studies have shown that anytime you can legitimately make a meal out of a cookie and milk, you're golden. As it happens, grown-ups won't turn these down, either. And, bonus! When made with flax ""eggs"" and gluten-free oats, these wholesome gems are vegan and gluten-free."
5013380~Roasted Rosemary Potatoes~5236~1041~201~100~52~53901~0~Parcooking in vinegar water helps set the starches so the potatoes get crisp, rather than floury, when roasted.
5013381~Blue Cheese Shortbread Leaves with Cream Cheese-Chutney Roulade~1320~151~6~35~61~1813~181~You can start making these savory cookies up to three days ahead. Even easier: Serve the cheese roll with store-bought crackers. (We especially liked this roulade made with a spiced cranberry-apple chutney, but any thick chutney will work.)
5013382~Lime-Pickled Red Onion~56~11~5~0~3~889~0~Acidity helps preserve the alliums’ flavor; either vinegar or citrus juice would do the trick.
5013383~Orzo with Garbanzo Beans, Goat Cheese, and Oregano~2178~307~20~61~82~538~71~Highly recommended!
5019568~Apple and Sausage Stuffing~5831~1073~66~170~95~14265~461~This delicious stuffing is similar to a savory bread pudding. It's best baked alongside, rather than inside, the bird.

5013386~Raspberry Trifle~2333~416~323~41~28~1094~526~Tip: Replace the cream (but keep the flavor) with 2 percent milk.

5014671~Plum-Blackberry Streusel Pie~5510~1185~682~71~93~1493~214~Beneath a humble, oaty streusel topping lies a sleek, inky jumble of plums and blackberries—talk about a delicious contrast. A combination of cornstarch and tapioca in the filling helps to keep the colors of the fruit true and to set up their juices nicely without becoming too thick.

5018633~Pickled Quail Eggs~1417~326~291~11~0~4902~0~When you're ready to slice these eggs, be sure to wipe your knife clean between every cut or you'll get the pink pickling liquid smeared on the yolk.
5013400~Roasted Yams with Crème Fraîche and Chives~280~21~12~0~22~1481~0~A thoroughly modern take on the classic baked potato with sour cream.
5013401~Eggplant Parmesan With Fresh Mozzarella~2569~288~25~151~96~4036~249~Removing all but a strip of the eggplant's skin lets the flesh meld with the sauce without falling apart.
5013402~Grilled Pork Chops with Pineapple Salsa~218~19~13~0~14~2908~0~Cumin and time over the coals give these hearty thick-cut pork chops deep flavor. A spicy-sweet tropical salsa made with fresh pineapple balances the dish.
5013403~Ginger and Honey Baby Back Ribs~492~111~36~4~0~21949~0~Ribs are among the constants on the world's barbecue trail, but just how theyre prepared reflects a strong regional and cultural bias. The vast ranch lands and forests of the New World, for example, led to American-style barbecue, with its large slabs of spareribs slow-roasted on a smoker for the better part of a day. Asians adopted a different strategy: cooking small cuts or single ribs on tiny grills engineered for fuel efficiency. The flavor would come not from wood smoke (Asians don't have wood to burn by the cord), but from the explosively flavored seasoning indigenous to the region, like lemongrass, ginger, and fish sauce. Case in point: These Cambodian-style ribs, from Sarun Pich, a chef at the Amansara resort in Siem Reap, Cambodia.
5013990~Strawberry Coulis~535~139~132~1~0~0~0~This recipe is an accompaniment for Vanilla Mousse Meringues and Fresh Berries.

5013790~Fish House Punch~13055~2302~1875~77~416~3366~335~Highly recommended!
5013409~Moroccan Carrot and Goat Cheese Sandwiches with Green Olive Tapenade~2344~112~74~36~206~6818~130~The inspiration for this recipe came from a tea sandwich one of our food editors discovered at Alice's Tea Cup, in Manhattan. It's surprisingly substantial — a bit like an overstuffed deli sandwich, but not nearly as heavy.
5013410~Campanelle with White Beans, Lemon, and Burrata~2628~313~28~134~109~3140~120~Highly recommended!
5013411~Green-Curry Chicken with Peas and Basil~909~70~38~94~25~5984~204~The ginger, coconut milk, curry paste, basil and cilantro in this are often used in Southeast Asian curries. Sautéing the chicken strips in olive oil adds a Western touch. For a nice finale, serve mango sorbet with canned lychees, small Chinese fruits available in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets.
5013412~Paad Thai~2791~448~39~95~66~7002~1040~(Stir-Fried Rice Noodles with Shrimp)

5013414~Lemon Layer Cake~9120~1348~1310~28~417~3659~831~If any cake could be called refreshing, this would be the one. Rich but light, it loses absolutely nothing from the absence of white flour.
5013415~Cauliflower Soup with Seared Scallops, Lemon Oil, and American Caviar~2545~154~40~40~178~4853~502~Now that imported caviar is no longer available, the domestic stuff is all the rage. Paired with lemon oil (sold at many markets), it's the ultimate garnish.
5013416~Sour Cherry Cobbler~6108~1279~1017~67~78~2315~222~Highly recommended!
5013417~Buffalo Chicken Burger~2502~179~22~116~138~4340~351~A bit of blue cheese in each patty ups the chicken's savoriness without adding much fat or calories.
5013418~Fever Cocktails~286~0~0~21~21~71~89~In honor of the late Peggy Lee, we adapted the classic Peggy cocktail, dubbing it Fever, as a touch of Dubonnet gives this drink the faintest pink blush.

5013430~All-Crustacean Canapés, Garnished with Deep-Fried Capers~3504~3~0~101~359~1512~917~Highly recommended!
5013431~S'mores Sandwich Cookies~5482~823~553~93~246~5233~350~In theory, campfire s'mores are amazing, but the reality is often a stale graham cracker sandwich filled with thick pieces of unmelted chocolate and gooey marshmallows oozing out the sides. This sandwich cookie makes your s'mores dreams come true. The honey and cinnamon-spiked soft cookie is big enough to hold not one, but two toasted marshmallows, and the thin chocolate coating melts perfectly inside.

5013438~Heirloom Tomato Terrine~1196~160~106~86~18~2286~44~Using his artist's eye, food editor and stylist Paul Grimes transformed the usual free-form summer tomato salad into a showstopping terrine with structure and elegance. A homemade vegetable broth is the base for the delicate aspic in which the curves of tomato, arranged by color, are suspended.

You can make salsa in minutes. It keeps forever. It is the antidote to any of your vegetable woes!

5020009~Fish Brine~55~14~14~0~0~5816~0~Fish deserve some salty foreplay just as much as pork and poultry. Every type of seafood is different in terms of density of the flesh, so different brine times are needed for different fish.
5013452~Watercress, Pear and Pomegranate Salad~1407~90~47~19~107~2117~105~Highly recommended!
5013454~Avocado, Kale, Pineapple, and Coconut Smoothie~433~62~35~5~19~489~0~Sub spinach for kale if you like.
5013458~Pasta Dough~1189~209~0~48~20~1164~4~For this pasta dough, we used a mixture of cake and all-purpose flours. It's too delicate when you're making noodles, but it's great for filled, double-edged pastas like ravioli.
5013456~Red-Lentil Soup~1399~246~45~60~17~3549~0~Red lentils, faster-cooking than other varieties of the legume, are the foundation of this earthy, rustic soup. Light but satisfying, it's a wonderful (and easy) start to an autumn meal.
5013457~Huevos Rancheros With Jalapeños and Garlic~788~77~5~15~38~815~370~I have had this served with chopped avocado, beans, rice, and all sorts. So please do feel free to include one (or all) of those as an accompaniment if you fancy it.

5013468~Skewered Strawberry & Marshmallow S'mores~612~137~60~13~0~1190~0~Backyard garden strawberries are often smaller than store-bought, so be the judge of how many strawberries you need for the skewers. Or even simpler, grill strawberries on a grill rack until a bit charred and warmed through and spoon atop frozen yogurt or ice cream.
5013470~Easy Green Curry With Chicken, Bell Pepper, and Sugar Snap Peas~2772~160~47~165~186~15582~586~Forget takeout—this satisfying Thai-inspired green curry is ready in just 20 minutes with a little help from a store-bought rotisserie chicken.

5013475~Grilled Scallops with Tabbouleh Salsa~860~121~57~54~39~9272~77~Plump scallops, sprinkled with salt and pepper, are lightly grilled and served with a salsa rich in parsley and diced vegetables. The salsa should be made just before eating; otherwise the liquid content of the vegetables will turn the dish watery.
5013476~Sugar Snap Peas with Tarragon Butter~281~37~12~8~11~1350~31~A seasonal abundance of peas means more for everyone. This easy side dish keeps them snappy and fresh with aromatic tarragon and lemon zest.
5015520~Fresh Strawberry Ice Cream~2190~178~178~12~175~276~920~Don't let the unexciting name of the recipe fool you—this ice cream is unusually good.

Guests then place the cooked chicken strips on lettuce leaves, add noodles and whatever garnishes they choose, roll up the leaves and complete the packages with a bit of the Sweet-and-Spicy Dipping Sauce. When all of the chicken has been eaten, divide the remaining broth among the guests.

5013487~Salsa Chicken Salad~675~35~11~35~49~2989~138~Sprinkle shredded cheddar over some tortilla chips, and pop them under the broiler for a minute-you'll have instant first-course nachos. All you need with the salad is a basket of tortillas or crusty bread. Mix some cinnamon into chocolate pudding to wrap up this Mexican-style dinner.
5013488~My Hero~1265~66~10~92~69~5411~244~Be sure to drain the salad before adding to the sandwich.
5018035~Apple-Raisin Chutney~4027~1027~918~5~1~2232~1~Although it's a perfect complement to pork, this chutney would also be tasty served with other roasted meats.
5013491~Sweet Corn and Tomato Salad with Fresh Cilantro~769~65~38~9~56~340~0~Fresh corn from a farmers' market or a grower's farmstand will taste the sweetest.
5013492~Braised Lamb With Rosemary and Garlic~2480~214~14~20~171~966~0~If you really want to go all out, you can brown the lamb in a wood-burning oven (erm, if you've got one handy) where it could absorb smoky flavors. For the rest of us mere mortals, that step for this recipe can be done in a hot oven.

5013499~Warm Black Mission Fig, Walnut Crunch, and Blue Cheese Tartlets~2733~286~218~38~169~973~241~This delicious last course is a little sweet and a little savory—like dessert and a cheese plate in one dish. If you can't find fresh figs, buy dried black Mission figs, soak them in warm water until very soft, then drain and pat dry.

5013504~Spinach Salad with Grilled Eggplant and Feta~2237~55~7~14~218~1821~0~The slightly sweet, almost flowery flavor of marjoram adds a delicate note to this Middle Eastern—inspired salad, though oregano is also fine. To be sure the eggplant is tender, slice into it before taking it off the grill—when properly done, it will be moist all the way through.
5013505~Wilted Chard With Shallots and Vinegar~492~50~7~2~27~200~0~The stems from Swiss chard shouldn't be trashed; they add texture and a layer of flavor to any sauté.

With no time to spare, and an impatient, hungry emperor waiting, the cook, a nimble and adaptive fellow, arranged the dumplings on a platter, burned sides up, and presented them to the emperor as a new dish that he called, quotie, which means ""stuck bottom."" The emperor was delighted. Legend or not, it is a fact that these browned half-moons filled with pork and vegetables were eventually sold daily by the thousands from small streetside stands to satisfy the morning habits of people in Beijing and Tianjin, who called them jiaozi, or ""little dumplings.""

5013656~Chicken and Fennel Salad Sandwiches~3131~90~17~25~303~13440~904~Roasting the chickens and using both dark and white meat results in chicken salad with deep flavor. (Buying rotisserie chickens will cut down on the timing, but be sure to choose minimally seasoned birds.) Fennel, standing in for the usual celery, along with fennel seed and fresh basil, adds an unexpected note of sophistication.
5013658~Southwest Fusilli with Tomatoes, Garlic and Chilies~1511~304~40~51~6~470~0~Highly recommended!
5013661~Asian Flank Steak~195~18~3~22~6~4157~45~This entrée is excellent for summer entertaining. It's even better — and easier — if you place the meat in the marinade a day in advance. Accompany with steamed white rice to catch the juices.
5013662~Miso-Marinated Salmon with Citrus and Shiitakes~501~83~63~18~7~778~46~Active time: 45 min Start to finish: 25 hr
5013663~Chicken Meatballs With Ginger and Miso~1359~84~18~76~86~8711~217~These flavor-packed meatballs are delicious whether poached (like in our Sumo Stew (Chanko Nabe) with Shrimp, Meatballs, and Bok Choy), grilled, or baked.
5013664~Open-Face Bacon-and-Egg Sandwiches with Arugula~1543~106~25~69~105~2429~485~Nick was inspired to make this dish while living in Philadelphia, where the sandwich is king. It's great for breakfast, or even a Sunday supper.
5013665~Roast Leg of Lamb on a Bed of Potatoes and Wilted Greens~7471~1401~290~134~129~48105~0~Highly recommended!
5013666~Arugula, Potato, and Green Bean Salad with Walnut Dressing~2733~517~106~55~39~15294~1~Finely chopped toasted walnuts bulk up the yogurt dressing for this gorgeous salad. It's pretty enough to serve to company, either as the main course of a vegetarian meal or as a meatless offering at a summer potluck.
5013667~Wild Mushroom Sauté~765~34~1~0~69~969~0~Sauté de Champignons Sauvages

5013670~Thai Roast Beef and Lettuce Rolls~564~122~73~11~2~6842~7~Active time: 15 min Start to finish: 15 min
5013671~Crab with Cantaloupe and Caviar – Sea Salad~2440~13~0~224~166~4543~1179~"I thrive on discovering new flavor combinations, and Sea is a great example of a totally thrown together idea that worked out beautifully. That day I was really in the mood for some crab salad, but I wanted to do something untraditional. One of my purveyors had sent me some Tuscan cantaloupe to try, so I first made a melon emulsion. Then I tossed the crabmeat with my Colvin Vinaigrette (which is basically good on anything). I thought that avocado would be great with the melon, so I started with a little melon on the plate, then I layered sliced ripe avocado and the crab mixture with a huge quenelle of caviar I had on hand to top it all off. Honestly, it was like heaven. I had so much crab that I made two mini ones for my two friends downstairs, and they were like, ""What the hell is this flavor combination? This is amazing!"" Give it a try—it's elegant and just incredibly good."
5013672~Swiss Chard Lasagna with Ricotta and Mushroom~3347~195~77~143~217~5574~507~Slightly bitter Swiss chard (which is a variety of beet) was reportedly named for the Swiss botanist who identified the green. In this dish, chard's earthy flavor balances out the rich, creamy béchamel sauce.

5013678~Penne in Cream Sauce with Sausage~5047~409~14~195~282~7374~903~Highly recommended!

5013680~Classic Ragu Bolognese~2822~329~55~151~126~3561~571~A certain magic happens as the beef and aromatic vegetables slowly cook down with wine, tomato paste, and broth.
5013682~Banana Layer Cake~8840~1273~858~89~378~3690~944~Highly recommended!

5013695~Quick-Marinated Skirt Steak with Sriracha Potatoes and Spinach~3816~398~84~177~160~17285~373~Roasted potatoes are pretty delicious all by themselves. But they're even better when you douse them with spicy mayo and a shower of umami-packed bonito flakes. You've probably seen these pink, feathery-looking shavings of smoked tuna in the ethnic section of the supermarket—and they're well worth taking home for this Asian take on surf and turf.
5013697~Ceviche Verde (Green Mexican Ceviche)~3827~211~138~165~177~11387~517~This recipe is part of the Epicurious Online Cooking School, in partnership with the Culinary Institute of America. To watch it being made, and to learn how to make other Mexican classics, check out the video classes.

5013699~Creamy Dill Dressing~633~48~9~26~34~1319~59~This is a good one for potato salad, too.
5013701~Salted Peanut Butter and Jelly Blondies~3871~524~383~113~197~2691~623~These are really peanut buttery and not too sweet, so the strawberry jam on top is a perfect complement.
5013702~Warm Pasta Salad with Mushrooms and Radicchio~679~77~9~16~27~1809~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5013707~Garlicky Eggplant Salad~698~45~9~1~55~19~0~Highly recommended!
5013711~"Zucchini-Wrapped Halibut ""Scallops"""~1688~86~43~109~91~1594~422~Between the bacon (around 200mg of sodium per slice) and the scallops (over 330mg per 3 ounces), the classic dish is too salty for me to enjoy. But when the bacon is replaced with smoky zucchini ribbons and the scallops are swapped out for halibut rounds, you have a whimsical reinterpretation that actually tastes equally thrilling.
5013715~Mustard-Grilled Pork~1769~34~14~162~98~9160~589~Mustard, tarragon, and a touch of sugar flavor the pork and its accompanying slaw.
5013716~Boilermaker Sauce~740~83~40~6~40~1411~23~A boilermaker is a classic one-two drink consisting of a shot of whiskey followed by a beer chaser. Those ingredients also come together in this all-American barbecue sauce. Use it on ribs, pork chops, chicken, even burgers (brush it on during the last ten minutes of grilling). If making ribs, brush them often during the first part of cooking with a mixture of one part cider vinegar to ten parts water and a pinch of dried crushed red pepper; that will keep them moist. This recipe makes enough for three pounds of meat or poultry and can be doubled easily.
5013720~Striped Bass in Agrodolce Sauce~3100~163~144~117~212~8193~368~Agrodolce, an Italian sweet-and-sour sauce, combines vinegar and sugar. For tender results, be sure to peel off any leathery outer layers from the shallots.
5013722~Christmas Tonic~140~14~15~1~6~24~3~Highly recommended!
5013723~Orange Layer Cake with Orange-Caramel Cream Cheese Frosting~15939~3453~2577~164~182~3858~906~A few tips: At several points in the recipe, components need to be chilled for a while before you can proceed, so plan accordingly. In our test kitchen, Philadelphia-brand cream cheese gave consistently good results. Note, too, that the cake can be completely assembled, then frozen for up to one week.
5013724~Creamy Corn with Chives~328~22~9~2~26~2667~63~This is creamy corn with no cream at all. Our trick? The juice of freshly cut corn thickened with cornstarch.
5013725~White Zinfandel Sangria~1366~244~239~4~30~1185~0~The choice of fresh fruit depends entirely on what's available, so don't be afraid to experiment. Mangoes, pineapples, apples, and strawberries are some fruits to consider, although the drink should include at least one citrus fruit, just for some zing.
5013726~Red Snapper Yuca Cakes with Mojo de Ajo~3286~509~122~11~132~4868~0~While in Costa Rica, Boston chef Steve Johnson was inspired to make fish cakes from leftover red snapper and boiled yuca. The combination takes clever advantage of the vegetable's starchy character, which binds the cakes together while allowing the flavor of the snapper to come through cleanly. We prefer to use frozen yuca, which has a better consistency and is easier to prepare.
5013727~Octopus with Linguine~1961~345~11~56~49~96~0~Though Rose Pascale always uses fresh octopus (sold as pulpo in many Latino markets), we found that it's generally sold frozen. You may need to special-order or reserve octopus from your local fish market several days ahead.
5013728~Oriental Black Bean and Garlic Sauce for Asparagus~197~18~2~3~9~2019~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5013741~Herbed Haddock Soup~1457~179~37~19~66~6750~220~Country bread and a salad of thickly sliced tomatoes sprinkled with oil, vinegar and crumbled bacon complete the supper. Strawberry tarts make a lovely finale.

5013748~Mocha and Raspberry Trifle~4915~766~644~35~179~1140~631~Definitely not Ye Olde English Classic, but very delicious and very contemporary. Using store-bought sponge cake (ask for it at your supermarket bakery) or pound cakes simplifies assembly.

5013755~Spaghetti with Crab and Tomatoes~2972~380~17~143~98~4542~485~Highly recommended!
5019338~Citrus Chiffon Cake~2397~369~185~41~85~1760~371~It's unusual to butter and flour the pan when making a chiffon cake, but we liked the delicate crust that resulted. Because we did it this way, the cake must be cooled, inverted, on a rack, not on a bottle (the usual procedure for chiffons), or it will fall right out of the pan!
5013757~Surf 'n' Turf Kebabs with Cilantro-Lime Sauce~3091~213~121~136~183~49879~317~Swordfish or lamb —guests can choose just one kind of kebab or both. (Chicken can be substituted for the lamb, if you prefer.) The same quick marinade flavors the kebabs, then gets reduced to a sauce for serving alongside.
5019469~Citrus Syrup~218~55~52~0~0~10~0~Highly recommended!

5013787~Coconut-and-Almond Candy~5205~837~798~48~184~368~0~The killer combination of coconut, almonds, and milk chocolate makes for a delectable candy bar. One of the most iconic of American candies, the Almond Joy, is famous for its creamy coconut filling topped with almonds and covered in milk chocolate. Its sibling, the Mounds bar, has the same coconut center but no almonds. Although the recipes for these two candies are top secret, it's possible to make wonderfully coconutty chocolate candies in your own home.
5013788~Lechón Asado~207~40~220~7~0~16995~0~From wild pigs fed on small nuts retrieved by ranch hands nimbly climbing royal palms to all day vigils around wooden roasting boxes, getting pork right is a serious Cuban affair. This Lechón Asado falls in between those extremes. The pork shoulder is marinated in mojo then oven-roasted over several hours, usually overnight. The heat is cranked up at the very end until the skin turns a deep golden brown. Traditionally made for Nochebuena, it’s a holiday dish that’s simple enough to make for any occasion. This recipe comes from Sofía Benítez Otero.

5013802~Cod with Potatoes and Preserved Lemon Relish~4709~718~205~160~117~18458~256~For this rustic interpretation of brandade, Aizpitarte uses desalinated salt cod, which is not easy to find. We got great results (and the right texture) by simply using fresh cod, but when it comes to the addictive relish spooned over the top, we wouldn't dare change a thing.

Although he likes to use white Muscat grapes for the sauce, the recipe works well with any color or variety of grape. We used red seedless grapes, and they yielded a beautiful dark-pink sauce.
5013833~Shrimp and Scallop Sauté~1887~83~15~176~83~4301~1114~New England has a large Portuguese population. Their numbers are most concentrated in Massachusetts fishing centers, such as New Bedford, Glouchester and Providencetown, where they've had an important influence on the cuisine. One of their specialties is fried scallops, Portuguese-style--a sauté of bay scallops in butter with garlic and parsley. We've elaborated on the basic dish by adding shrimp, mushrooms, green onions and a white wine sauce. Serve it over rice, and offer buttered peas or broccoli on the side.

5013847~Cincinnati Chili~8844~1134~531~404~315~14648~1180~"Home turf: Ohio
Local flavor: Spaghetti topped with chili: It's as simple (and as bizarrely satisfying) as that. This combo has inspired some 200 chili parlors in the Cincinnati area. What sets it apart? It's thinner than your average chili and is packed with aromatic spices (allspice, cinnamon)—and a touch of chocolate. *Beef is the protein of choice, but we've gone with lamb here, which is amazing with the spice blend.
Make it a meal: garlic bread, salad with ranch dressing, and Samuel Adams black lager ($8 per six-pack)."
5013848~Pumpkin Potato Puree~3738~550~135~87~119~16086~296~This side dish of silky mashed potatoes sweetened with pumpkin (left over from Pumpkin Muffins ), seasoned with fresh sage, and laced with melty strands of Fontina cheese is full of favorite autumnal flavors.

We love it with pork chops or turkey cutlets.

5013891~Ranch Beans~1817~177~37~96~101~7487~248~Chuckwagon cooks used to simmer beans for days, and the cowboys always thought they tasted best on the third day.

This sturdy salad travels with ease, whether you're taking it to the beach or to a summer party with friends. Another plus: you can make it up to 24 hours in advance.

5013929~Green Tea Cheesecake~815~14~13~7~86~1183~236~We drink green tea all the time, at home or in restaurants, and it is an essential part of the Japanese culture. Matcha is a type of green tea often used in the formal tea ceremony, but it is also used in a number of Japanese desserts. It doesn't give a strong tea flavour but creates a nice colour and slight dry tartness at the end of the palate. This cake is very light and refreshing compared to many New York- style cheesecakes.
5013930~Romaine and Broccoli Salad with Creamy Roasted Garlic Dressing~2284~78~29~24~172~3754~253~Highly recommended!

5013935~Grilled Pork Tenderloin with Fresh Fig Skewers~794~74~56~23~51~611~79~Fig trees love warmer climates. However, for the adventurous northern gardener, the best way to grow figs is in a container that can be placed outdoors in warm weather and then brought indoors to winter. The best variety of fig tree for a container is the Petite Negri fig. It's a small- to medium-sized black fruit with sweet, red flesh. If you have great weather, Mission figs are superb. The natural sweetness of figs goes well with pork tenderloin in this dish. If you like, use sturdy fresh rosemary branches (as from the Tuscan variety) for the skewers.
5013936~Mustard-Glazed Carrots and Pearl Onions~897~107~84~5~48~674~94~This combination of slowly simmered carrots and onions is loaded with deep, full flavor that goes well with grilled meats.
5013937~Celery Stuffed with Smoked Gouda and Sun-Dried Tomatoes~2151~17~6~73~184~2675~421~Highly recommended!
5013938~Shrimp Bisque with Pernod~1038~49~15~23~82~5190~408~Highly recommended!
5013939~Pumpkin Pie with Pepita Nut, and Ginger Topping~3183~321~297~47~202~1592~919~"The technique: A single-crust pie requires only a bottom crust and is the best choice for a custard filling, like pumpkin pie.
The payoff: You have to make only one pie crust, and if it breaks or cracks it's easy enough to cobble the crust together in the pie dish. Most of the bottom crust will be covered with filling, so it doesn't have to look perfect."
5013940~Malted Walnut Pie~6554~483~267~102~470~3824~788~Adding barley malt syrup offers a rounder, less-sweet note in this take on pecan pie. Look for it at health food stores.
5013941~Persian Love Cake~4946~518~327~56~279~1625~1160~This chiffon cake filled with rose-scented whipped cream is inspired by the aromatics found in Persian, Turkish, and Indian confections. Cardamom seeds have more flavor than the ground powder and are like little explosions of spice in the cake.
5013942~Fresh Corn and Basil Cornbread~6611~910~165~144~153~4350~623~Highly recommended!
5013944~Parmesan Chicken with Mixed Baby Greens~1574~80~2~111~90~4246~167~Serve with: Steamed broccoli and roasted potatoes. Dessert: Baked apples.
5020005~Cranberry Relish~955~251~245~0~0~1~0~No Thanksgiving dinner would be complete without cranberry relish. It can be made in large batches if you want to make enough for the winter.
5013946~String Bean & Arugula Salad~961~103~16~29~43~1408~0~In this unusual pairing, the string beans and baby arugula work wonders for each other. Wilting the arugula with the hot, garlicky grilled beans is a nice trick for bringing the two together. While you can use regular arugula if you must, baby arugula is far milder in flavor, so try to find it if you can.
5018073~Apple Pie with Cheddar Crust~3449~473~94~139~193~5400~320~A crumbly slab of Cheddar is a centuries-old accompaniment to a slice of apple pie; it imparts character in a way that a scoop of ice cream can't hope to match. Adding grated cheese to the crust tweaks the tradition, thus bringing an iconic dessert full circle.
5016022~Apricot-Glazed Turkey with Roasted Onion and Shallot Gravy~2712~238~156~17~178~3716~499~Highly recommended!

5013953~Sweet Potato Julius~1249~228~175~9~27~1067~0~The first “real” recipe I ever tried was for the famous orange Julius. It was back in home-ec class and the no-fail recipe instantly became my favorite. Now I’m giving traditional orange Julius an upgrade by combining the vitamins C and A, potassium, fiber, and carotenoids found in sweet potatoes with tangy orange. This is a winning combination, light and refreshing with pops of citrus, yet dense and filling because of the sweet potato. Enjoy this as a meal or post-workout drink, or split it with a loved one for a snack! It’s ridiculously good.
5019945~Pico de Gallo~136~27~18~4~0~75~0~This classic Mexican topping can be made with or without jalapeños. Keep in mind that adding the seeds ups the heat.
5013955~Red Chili Onion Rings~1560~272~89~47~23~8003~85~Highly recommended!
5013956~Shaved Fennel, Artichoke, and Parmesan Salad~667~18~3~3~69~96~0~The method of preparing this salad — paper-thin shavings of vegetables, usually raw, tossed together and lightly dressed just before serving — has become a regular theme on the restaurant's menus. The variations are extensive (peppers, celery, and radishes are often added) and always fresh and satisfying.
5013957~Potato, Red Pepper, and Fennel Salad~687~25~3~10~63~643~0~This salad, crunchy with red pepper and fennel, pairs well with the broiled trout or with grilled lamb or chicken.

5013963~Zucchini-Parmesan Squares~5730~633~320~141~285~7187~1213~Highly recommended!
5013965~Sausage, Red Onion, and Wild Mushroom Pizza~1704~47~7~146~119~4690~223~Fresh pizza dough is now available at some supermarkets; look for it in the refrigerated deli case or use thin Boboli crusts.

5013973~Oat Shortcakes with Sautéed Apples, Cinnamon, and Whipped Cream~2892~174~13~43~234~542~1029~Baking pro Alice Medrich's gluten-free oat sponge cake, from her book Flavor Flours, makes a wonderful base for apples caramelized with brown sugar and cinnamon, along with a dollop of pure whipped cream.

5016991~Aioli~9770~33~0~12~1114~140~370~Highly recommended!
5013982~Vine-Smoked Trout~165~9~3~17~5~682~53~Trout rule the mountain streams of America. I remember the fantastic flavor of freshly caught trout in Wyoming cooked over a campfire. They were so delicious, we had trout for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This recipe echoes that experience, sans the stinging nettles and porcupines. If you like, you could also stuff the trout with an herb or horseradish butter, fresh lemon slices, or a cornbread stuffing.

5013992~Crab and Roasted Red Bell Pepper Soup~2038~62~22~37~172~4266~476~An elegant soup that can be prepared a day ahead. Begin the occasion by passing smoked chicken canapés. To make them, spread mayonnaise over crustless sandwich bread, and top with thinly sliced smoked chicken. Cut the open-face sandwiches into triangles, and garnish each of them with a few onion sprouts.
5018868~Roast Turkey with Sherry Wine Vinegar Gravy~1186~100~26~17~70~531~223~The vinegar in this gravy gives it an appealing tartness. Round off the meal with cranberry sauce and steamed broccoli.

5014002~Chicken Wings Five Ways~9491~0~0~766~700~2901~3105~Forget marinades—who has time to think ahead anymore? The easiest, fastest, and, yes, we're calling it, best method for adding some pizzazz to your grilled chicken is to toss it quickly in a sauce after it's been cooked. Come on, guys, it's the secret behind Buffalo chicken wings! Everybody loves wings, so alert your friends to come on over for a backyard wing feed. Make as many sauces as you'd like, and let each person embellish their wings the way they want.
5014003~Cremini Mushroom Pasta with Wilted Arugula and Goat Cheese~1119~144~26~51~35~40143~71~Plain old pasta goes low-fat gourmet.
5014004~Unstuffed Sweet-and-Sour Cabbage~1341~71~27~89~73~2641~271~Classic stuffed cabbage is a time-consuming endeavor. This unorthodox version, which uses dried cranberries and a combination of beef and pork, is much easier—and, we like to think, even better.

5014010~Chicken Curry Soup with Coconut and Lime~1027~203~5~42~3~1220~53~Here, lime juice replaces the traditional lemongrass, which can be hard to find. The result is a quick, authentic-tasting Thai-style soup. If coconut milk is unavailable, substitute 1 3/4 cups half and half mixed with 3/4 teaspoon imitation coconut extract.
5014011~Grilled Lamb Chops with Red Wine, Garlic and Honey Glaze~1239~32~22~50~99~3312~157~The honey does not sweeten the chops-it just helps them brown. For an authentic accompaniment, uncork a bottle of the pungent resin-flavored Greek wine called retsina, or simply opt for a favorite Sauvignon Blanc. Serve coffee ice cream and purchased baklava to complete the menu.
5014012~Herb-Crusted Rack of Lamb with New Potatoes~3465~625~171~61~71~16423~0~This recipe calls for fairly small racks of lamb, about a pound each. If your lamb is larger, the cooking time will increase, but you can get away with serving single, not double, chops.

5014015~The Manhattan~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~"Bourbon:
Bourbon is a type of whiskey that is only made in America from at least 51% corn. In that regard, it differs from Scotch and Irish whiskeys, which are made from malted barley. Rye whiskey is made from—you guessed it—rye. There's a helluva lot more you could learn on the subject of whiskeys, but you're not gonna learn it here. All you need to know is that good bourbon is delicious."

5014024~Poached Cod with Tomato and Saffron~648~54~3~12~33~861~21~You want to cook the cod at a lazy simmer; it will make all the difference between buttery, flaky fish and rubbery, tough fillets.
5014026~Pad Thai~1572~191~55~52~70~2501~198~"There are two categories of entrée in Thailand: dishes served with rice, and noodle dishes, which are presented as one-pot meals and often eaten on the go. Rice noodles cook more quickly than wheat pasta and are the perfect neutral vehicle for intense Thai flavors. This Pad Thai is not the dish from the neighborhood take-out joint. ""It ain't made with chicken,"" says Ricker, whose traditional take—pleasantly funky with fish sauce and preserved radish and a touch sour from tamarind—is meant to be eaten in the evening as a stand-alone dish."
5014027~Vietnamese Sandwiches with Five-Spice Chicken~1763~381~251~45~8~9889~89~Called banh mi in Vietnam, these delicious sandwiches are ubiquitous throughout the country and are usually eaten for breakfast. This version uses chicken instead of the traditional pork and pâté.

5014034~Swiss Chard with Beets, Goat Cheese, and Raisins~1597~192~73~49~75~5400~0~The slight bitterness of the greens is tempered by the sweetness of the beets and the raisins, while the cheese adds a creamy richness.

What makes these matzo balls unique are the seasonings: cardamom, turmeric, and lime. Pair this soup with the Sabzi Khordan edible herbs platter and you’ve got a classic Iranian Shabbat meal.

5014047~Spiced Roasted Turkey~1303~78~15~13~56~15506~73~Pushing a buttery spice paste underneath the turkey's skin allows the flavor to perfume the meat—and gives it extra juiciness. Here, we use the favorite Indian combination of garlic and ginger paste, along with the technique of toasting spices and then grinding them, for the freshest, most powerful result. Though the paste may smell pungent, its flavor, once the turkey has been cooked, is quite gentle.
5014048~Passion Fruit Caramel Sauce~2235~482~478~0~46~3~126~This recipe is an accompaniment for Mascarpone Cheesecake with Roasted Cashew Crust.

My first choice—as far as mushroom fillers—is domestic oyster, shiitake, or portobellos, which you can easily grill (or sauté!) ahead of time. Also, Manchego is another delicious option for the cheese."
5014108~Homemade Bratwurst Bites with Beer and Horseradish Mustard~1526~15~8~101~117~5328~306~If you have a food processor, you can make sausage from scratch. Adding pork fat to the meat gives these bite-size sausage patties a tender texture. Call your butcher in advance to make sure he sets aside some extra pork fat for you. To help the mixture blend more easily, be sure to freeze the pork pieces before grinding them in the processor. Keep in mind that the sausage needs to chill overnight so that the flavors have time to develop.

5014218~Grilled Lamb Chops with Salmoriglio Sauce~1100~34~29~21~100~2801~81~Salmoriglio is a strong, pungent lemon-herb sauce, originally from Calabria and Sicily. Serve the lamb with the chopped Greek salad to start and some grilled bread for soaking up the sauce.

5014220~Herb-Brined Pork Prime Rib Roast~1392~366~360~0~0~70167~0~The pork is prepared for roasting like a prime rib of beef; you can follow the method here or have your butcher do it for you. For best results, start brining the pork five days before you plan to roast it.
5015625~Basic Polenta~331~70~4~9~0~5343~0~This soft polenta is good topped with parmesan and fresh thyme and rosemary.
5014223~Spiced Onion Marmalade~1141~154~106~4~55~18~0~This marmalade would also be delicious with roast Cornish game hens. If the sweet Maui onions aren't available, substitute Vidalia.

5014226~Light Refried Black Beans~230~33~0~0~7~0~0~Refried beans are typically made from pinto beans, but black beans work well, too. Add a dab of sour cream if you crave a little richness.
5014227~Lemon Curd and Blueberry Trifle~4732~413~413~12~361~315~1637~The ideal summer dessert and make-ahead treat (it can chill for two days before serving). Instead of the traditional custard, whipped cream folded into cream cheese is the easy filling in this version.
5014228~Leek and Potato Soup~1118~134~23~18~49~6922~126~Leeks are easy to cultivate, but they do require a long growing season. This soup is one of the easiest to prepare, and it gets a colorful boost with the addition of fresh spinach leaves.

5014235~Shrimp With Avocado-Mango Salsa~2179~302~44~188~37~5304~880~In addition to being a great source of good-for-you fat, avocados are full of fiber and bloat-busting potassium.
5014236~Ginger-Pear Marmalade~5349~1427~1422~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5014237~Green Onion-Parmesan Popovers~140~6~3~15~10~3048~370~These popovers are like individual Yorkshire puddings. To make a dozen large popovers, just double the recipe and use two pans.
5014238~Stuffed Crepes with Mushrooms, Ham and Bechamel Sauce~3991~260~42~202~230~8139~984~Rich and satisfying, this main course from L'Osteria del Forno in San Francisco is similar to cannelloni. At the restaurant, they serve the crepes in individual gratin dishes.

5014240~Hoisin-Glazed Pork and Turkey Meat Loaf~3297~338~51~175~121~9840~793~Meatloaf needs no introduction, but this one gets kicked up a notch with the Asian flair of fresh ginger, scallions, and a hoisin sauce glaze. It's familiar but exotic at the same time, and so simple to make.
5014241~Watercress and Radish Salad~743~56~30~12~55~594~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

In this version, the combination of artichokes, olives, capers, and lemon zest is not only beautiful, but bold in flavor.
5014245~Bulgur with Leeks, Cranberries, and Almonds~3568~643~36~96~80~4595~189~Highly recommended!
5014246~Sour Orange, Red Onion, and Parsley Mojo~946~0~0~0~110~1938~0~"This recipe differs slightly from classic mojo in that it uses red onion instead of garlic. It's best to make this mojo a bit ahead of time so that the color of the red onion ""bleeds"" into the sour orange. The traditional accompaniment is grilled pork, but it's also wonderful with well-roasted chicken — charring its skin brings out the full flavors of the mojo."
5019718~Paula Wolfert's Seven-Day Preserved Lemons~118~29~27~0~0~14~0~Preserved lemons, sold ready-made in Moroccan souks, are essential to that country's cuisine. The peel, pulp, and juice squeezed from the lemons can all be used. Sometimes, however, the juice and preserving brine can be bitter; use fresh lemon juice in that case.
5014252~Apple Crumble and Vanilla Ice Cream~5455~1212~582~96~36~2~0~Highly recommended!
5014253~Chicken and Mixed Vegetable Stew~1359~150~23~25~70~3469~174~Parsnips, carrots, leeks and baby potatoes complement the chicken in this appealing one-dish supper. It's fun to begin the meal with a good old-fashioned relish tray--we like carrot and celery sticks, radishes and sweet pickles--and to end with a fresh fruit pie. Uncork a distinctive Sauvignon Blanc.
5014254~Orzo with Tomatoes, Feta, and Green Onions~3533~399~51~86~202~4575~0~Highly recommended!
5014255~Marinated Sturgeon with Moroccan Chickpea Salad~3910~180~64~35~343~2140~41~Highly recommended!
5014256~Deep-Dish Apple Pie~1856~322~261~0~64~1570~94~My most coveted pie is of the apple variety. To me, nothing says an afternoon out by the grill than having an apple pie to finish off the experience. What sets this pie apart from your normal apple pie is that I use a whopping thirteen apples that I slowly cook down with Vietnamese cinnamon and brown sugar, creating a collection of flavors so distinctively comforting, you'll never search for another apple pie recipe. Use Maker's Mark bourbon as it is currently the only gluten-free bourbon available.
5014257~Chestnut, Onion, and Currant Stuffing~7796~1520~202~217~105~15872~214~Multi-grain breads can vary widely in density. As a result, the 10 cups diced bread called for below may weigh a little more or less than 1 pound. We preferred a light-textured seven-grain bread for this stuffing.
5016139~"Sage and Onion ""Roast"""~1947~313~40~49~52~1087~370~This is the baked terrine I like to make for Sunday lunch, served with all the traditional trimmings of roast vegetables, steamed greens, and Yorkshire puddings . Leftovers can be reheated and served midweek with gravy, steamed green beans, and a generous spoonful of horseradish on the side.
5014259~Roasted Potato, Garlic, and Red Pepper Salad~5448~1057~217~100~73~30463~0~Highly recommended!

5014261~Hot Chocolate Baked French Toast~6449~583~452~72~455~4334~1457~With a dense custardy inside, a crispy crust, and an extra dose of hot chocolate sauce to pour over the top, this is the most indulgent, decadent breakfast you can prep in advance for Christmas morning.
5014262~Artichoke and Eggplant Panini~1793~98~4~43~135~1988~193~Grilling is the name of the game for a vegetarian powerhouse stacked with meaty eggplant, melted Fontina cheese, and a luscious artichoke mayonnaise.
5014263~Combo Reuben~1213~103~40~15~79~2346~174~The Reuben sandwich and the Rosen family date back to when Alan's Grandpa Harry and his brother Mike ran the Enduro Sandwich Shoppes in the late 1920s in Manhattan. That began a long Rosen history of serving some of the best Reubens in New York—but not always with corned beef! Today you can walk into Junior's and still order the Original Reuben, made only with corned beef. But now you also have the option of a Turkey Reuben with melted Swiss and coleslaw, a Pastrami Reuben, and this one, the Combo Reuben, which is overstuffed with corned beef and pastrami. Feel free to make them any way you like. At Junior's each Reuben comes with grilled sauerkraut and melted Swiss and is always on rye bread, hot off the grill, with potato salad on the side.
5014265~Napa Cabbage Salad with Buttermilk Dressing~574~82~36~19~21~3406~31~Topping Napa cabbage and radishes with a distinctively tangy dressing results in a salad that's as lively as it is simple.
5014266~Sheet-Pan Chicken Saltimbocca With Roasted Potatoes and Crispy Kale~2905~426~108~94~77~14481~181~Fancy enough for company but easy enough for a weeknight, this complete Italian-inspired meal is cooked on two baking sheets, making cleanup a breeze.
5014267~Tomato, Fennel, and Crab Soup~1248~111~53~62~57~2529~239~To make this dish vegan, skip the crab.
5014268~Chicken, Green Bean and Goat Cheese Salad~7597~159~56~160~712~2851~164~Components of this salad can be prepared one day ahead, then tossed together at the last minute. Offer white wine spritzers and iced tea with lunch. Colorful ornamental kale can be found at some supermarkets and specialty foods stores.
5014269~Southern Rice Pilaf Stuffing with Ham, Pecans and Greens~4971~635~157~162~210~13085~697~At Thanksgiving, rice stuffings are standard on many southern tables. This one, a combination of white rice and wild rice, gets more regional notes from collard greens, pecans and ham.
5014271~Spiced and Grilled Steaks With Citrus Chutney~633~141~115~6~3~12616~0~The sugar in the dry spice mix will help these steaks take on color quickly, so keep a close eye on them.
5014272~Carrot, Avocado, and Orange Salad~419~54~9~4~16~378~0~"This is my Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon salad. The two main ingredients—carrot and avocado—might not seem compatible or connected, but your first bite will convince you otherwise. The carrots are roasted with cumin and paired with orange, both classic pairings for the vegetable. The citrus goes great with cilantro, and both are a fine match for avocado. Before you know it, you have this fresh, vibrant salad. I love the carrots roasted to the same creamy softness of avocado. The contrast comes not from the texture but from the fact that one's warm from the oven and the other's cool from the fridge.
Sorry if I got your hopes up, but despite the salad's nickname, there's no bacon."
5016516~Rustic Rub~123~0~0~0~0~17448~0~You'll have more spice rub than you need for the Grillades . Try this seasoning on fish, pork, or beef dishes.
5014274~Mushroom and Leek Soup with Parsley Dumplings~3577~385~69~95~173~15665~633~Porcini and crimini mushrooms give this hearty soup its deep, almost meaty flavor. Cottage cheese holds the cheesy, parsley-flecked dumplings together.
5014276~Lime Cordial~1774~473~473~0~0~0~0~Lime cordial is a mixture of sweet limeade syrup and beer, club soda, or seltzer, in a ratio of about 3 parts syrup to 1 part beer or soda (the syrup by itself can also be properly called lime cordial). The wonderfully refreshing drink both complements and tames intense spices.
5014277~Roast Chicken Stuffed with Fennel and Garlic~295~61~3~3~0~1454~0~Potatoes roasted with olive oil and chopped fresh rosemary are a nice accompaniment. What to drink: Poggio del Sasso.
5014278~Roasted Tomato–Cashew Salsa~187~36~3~0~0~3893~0~If we had to give this salsa a heat index rating, it would get three out of five chiles.
5014279~Pork and Ham Loaf with Marmalade-Mustard Glaze~3706~169~113~223~224~15910~1136~Old-fashioned meat loaf gets a new lease on life in this recipe. Use the processor to chop leftover ham (or some purchased ham) for this flavorful loaf. Serve this with mashed potoates, corn bread, buttered peas, and a favorite beer or dry red wine.
5014280~Paprika-Roasted Chicken, Potatoes, and Radishes With Salsa Verde~1823~372~70~33~12~14083~0~This recipe is part of our Spring Grocery Bag Menu featuring 5 easy weeknight dinners made from 1 grocery bag of ingredients.

5014287~Blueberry-White Chocolate Mousse Tart~3033~435~175~54~112~1400~340~Blueberries top a creamy light mousse in this terrific dessert. It can be made a day ahead, then garnished with the white chocolate shavings before serving.
5014288~Stuffed Poblano Chiles with Avocado and Potatoes~3370~465~259~25~147~4193~56~Poblanos Rellenos con Papas y Aguacate
5014289~Sweet-and-Sour Cherry Turnovers with Goat Cheese Cream~5202~708~562~56~274~1162~655~Frozen puff pastry helps these come together easily, and the tart goat cheese cream balances their richness. If you can't find sour cherries, double the amount of sweet ones and up the lemon juice to 1 1/2 tablespoons.
5014290~Grilled Vegetables with Chipotle Dressing~560~77~51~8~20~1042~44~Highly recommended!

5014294~Fresh Peach Chutney~1898~473~441~4~3~1971~0~Highly recommended!
5014295~Orange-Maple Pork Ribs~2883~230~185~197~129~5030~753~Baby back ribs are less fatty than spareribs, and this marinade is flavorful without being a heavy barbecue sauce.
5014296~Raspberry-Yogurt Cake~5973~1135~807~155~195~1589~885~The yogurt helps make this moist cake especially tender. Great for brunch or tea.
5014297~Bacon and Molasses Beans~1005~81~35~32~53~3542~115~Highly recommended!

5014306~Cumin Pork Roast with Wild Mushroom Sauce~1649~344~0~41~34~285~94~Serve this flavorful roast with its rich mushroom gravy, the mashed potatoes here and sautéed carrots. A fruity Zinfandel would make a good wine choice.
5014308~Raspberry, Whiskey & Oat Cheesecake~512~58~53~15~25~288~370~Here, the building blocks of Scottish cranachan are brought together in a different guise, layered into an alternately crisp, creamy, and fruity cheesecake. It's not as rustically simple as the dessert that inspired it, but it does, I think, stay true to cranachan's ingredient-centric ethos, with honey, raspberries, whiskey, and oats in perfect balance.
5014309~Red Wine Beef Stew~8973~552~121~505~503~29506~1710~Tender and succulent, this red wine-braised beef stew is the ultimate one-pot meal, loaded with tender potatoes and carrots. Don't forget to bring over a loaf of crusty French bread for sopping up the rich sauce.

5014320~Cherry Tomato Vinaigrette~525~31~20~4~41~189290~0~Trust us: Your first batch of this condiment will not be your last. Spoon it over the Ricotta Omelets , or see the Cooks' notes for other ways to enjoy it.

5014324~Jealous Marys~167~16~11~2~9~2748~7~This recipe combines the cool taste of cucumber with the flavors of a Bloody Mary. You'll have to prepare 2 batches for 12 drinks. If you have a small blender, you may have to make smaller batches.
5018885~Cranberry Kir~102~26~10~0~0~42~0~Cranberries are cultivated in Canada, and tradition there calls for hosts to make a punch for Christmas guests. Here, the crop and the custom merge in a delightful champagne cocktail, which takes a French turn with the addition of crème de cassis.
5014326~Vegetable Green Curry~400~48~23~2~20~1318~0~The sweet potato and coconut milk balance the spiciness of this dish. Serve it over white rice, and dinner is ready.
5014327~Baked Tomatoes~800~89~7~8~44~2556~0~This is a gem from my mother's notebook of Nonna Mary's recipes. I remember Nonna Mary serving these tomatoes along with assorted grilled meats during the summer in Cesenatico. They are also a perfect accompaniment to veal cutlets, and together they make a great sandwich, one of my favorite lunches that my mother would pack for me to take to school.
5014328~Black Bean-Soy Sauce~382~54~1~18~7~6407~0~This would also be good on broiled sea bass or red snapper fillets.

5014331~Roasted Herb Potato Medley~10573~2023~405~200~160~60537~0~"Lane Crowther, Bon Appétit contributing editor, says, ""When I was young, the potatoes on the holiday table were always mashed. Even today, my mother, who is still in charge of our Thanksgiving dinners, will rarely stray from tradition. Either there has to be a trade-off to get her to try something new, or—as in the case of this recipe—innovation simply comes as an addition to the menu, not a replacement. Well, with so many different kinds of potatoes available nowadays, I like to mix varieties for their contrasting flavors, textures and colors. This combination of red potatoes and Yukon Gold is an easy-to-make and great-tasting accompaniment to any meal."""
5014332~Fennel and Carrot Confit~2703~14~9~1~306~877~0~Cooking anything very gently in oil produces a deliciously moist result (duck confit, for example), and this is no exception. The soft, tangled ribbons of carrot and fennel turn velvety and are balanced by slivers of lemon zest and the warm spark of cayenne.
5014333~Strawberry-Ricotta Parfait~1334~83~13~44~90~1348~0~Highly recommended!
5014334~Chickpea Stew~759~108~45~9~28~1299~0~The cumin really enhances this dish. Cook this spice with the onions to bring out its aroma. Lemon juice brightens the flavors while honey softens them.

5014341~Three Way Garlic Pasta with Beans and Peppers~589~45~4~24~29~4429~52~This is a satisfying vegetarian main course that takes full advantage of the flavor possibilities of garlic, here cooked until soft for sweetness and body, sautéed until golden for depth, and added raw for brightness.
5014342~Sweet-Potato Pie with Gingersnap Pecan Crust~2054~230~209~21~124~971~528~In many sweet-potato pies, the ginger and spices overwhelm the flavor of the potatoes.

The recipe uses water as liquid, but you can start with chicken stock or fish stock to make an especially flavorful broth that would be great for sipping on its own.
5016234~Lumpia Wrappers~341~99~0~52~0~195~4~"These are very similar to crêpes—the staple of Brittany—but thinner and more delicate (and the filling is like nothing you'll find in the French tradition). Though they're often called ""Philippine Egg Rolls,"" lumpia —again, like most crêpes—require no cooking once they're filled."

5014530~Horseradish Deviled Eggs~356~44~2~17~10~730~370~Not your standard deviled eggs, these are bright from the addition of vinegar and horseradish and are broiled just before serving.

5014533~Mussel Soup with Avocado, Tomato, and Dill~2106~116~39~206~78~4504~821~This soup was inspired by a meal at the Copenhagen microbrewery Nørrebro Bryghus.

5014541~Parisian Passover Coconut Macaroons~1162~296~295~9~0~195~4~The secret to these macaroons' texture is the Italian meringue, composed of egg whites and a boiling sugar syrup. When baking these for Passover, dust the sheets with matzo cake meal; you can use flour at other times.

5014550~Sufganiyot~1531~333~82~131~38~507~454~The young State of Israel has created many of its own customs. One is serving jelly doughnuts at Hanukkah, which are fried in oil to symbolize the miracle of the oil that lasted for eight days instead of one.
5014551~"Charred Pear Sorbet with Goat Cheese ""Snow"""~455~31~18~29~24~2139~83~Don't worry about getting too much color on your pears—they will gain more caramel flavor the darker they go. This unusual dessert is a play on flavors—savory alongside sweet—and textures.

5014554~Bacon-Molasses Breakfast Sausage~1292~9~5~74~105~3752~248~MAKING BREAKFAST SAUSAGE is an old family tradition for us. My grandpa's family used to raise their own hogs, and when it came time for butchering day, they made sure that nothing went to waste. All parts of the animal were used—for hams, bacon, lard, and sausage. My grandpa was in charge of making the breakfast sausage—a tradition he passed on to us.

5014556~Sirloin Kebabs with Southeast-Asian-Style Spice Paste~1953~46~17~138~127~4963~394~This paste showcases the layered flavors typical of Southeast Asian cooking. While the lemongrass does require a bit of work, its subtle but penetrating flavor is key. Adjust the amount of jalapeño peppers according to your heat tolerance and the heat level of the chiles you are using. We also like to use this spice paste on any type of grilled lamb.
5014557~Provencal Salad~2621~413~88~74~57~147284~427~The vegetables, along with the canned Italian tuna, in this colorful tossed salad create a positively satisfying meal. (Using an imported brand of tuna will make all the difference.)

5014560~Double Chocolate Espresso Cookies~6630~1020~566~170~319~4413~1120~Two warnings about these cookies: Don’t give them to young children before bedtime and don’t leave them lying around, if you want any left for yourself. These cookies are crisp on the edges and have a chewy middle strewn with pockets of soft chocolate. The espresso powder, as Kelsey (The Naptime Chef) noted, amplifies the chocolate, but not the sweetness, making it a grown-up cookie. When making any cookies, make sure to cream the butter really well—this aerates the cookies and integrates the sugar—but be conservative with your mixing once the dry ingredients are added.
5014561~Roasted Beet and Sugar Snap Pea Salad~639~38~20~5~55~907~0~Dill and arugula complement this lovely salad.

5014570~Seared Scallops with Ginger Sauce~1462~41~3~18~123~926~188~The simple, delicious and versatile ginger sauce would also be terrific with shrimp. Look for rice vinegar in the Asian foods section of the supermarket. Serve the scallops with crusty bread or rice.

Seasoning, cooking, and crisping the meat over the course of three days mean you don't have to spend hours in the kitchen the day you're hosting a big meal. In fact, the extra time your pork spends in the refrigerator only improves the taste. This is the perfect-for-a-party pork that gives you plenty of time to drink a beer and watch (or play) a game or two before grilling up crispy, tender slabs of pork shoulder for a crowd.
5014581~Watermelon Sundae~1956~370~345~17~51~563~140~Fresh and creamy all at once, this clever combination of rich ricotta ice cream and icy-cold watermelon chunks is a twist on the classic Creamsicle. Shaved bittersweet chocolate complements both flavors beautifully.

5014596~Passion-Fruit Gelée with Basil Cream~851~199~195~12~0~56~0~Though this recipe owes a debt to that icon of childhood desserts, Jell-O with whipped cream, the interplay of floral passion fruit and herbal basil is nothing if not elegant.
5014597~Slow-Roasted Arctic Char with Lemon-Mustard Seed Topping~274~17~2~2~18~308~0~This mild wild fish replete with omega-3 fatty acids combines the tastes of trout and salmon; it is available in the winter when wild salmon is still a month away. Slow-roasting a fish high in fat keeps it moist and flavorful.
5014599~Café de Paris~342~87~0~9~1~196~10~Highly recommended!
5014600~Roast Beef with Wild Mushroom Sauce and Caramelized-Shallot Mashed Potatoes~2052~266~28~25~104~4597~157~Ask your butcher for the chateaubriand (the thicker end) of the fillet, and have him trim it for you.

The highlight of my meal there was called Lucca pasta, a blend of fettuccine, chicken and vegetables in a creamy, slightly spicy sauce,"" says Debra Adam of St. Paul, Minnesota."
5014606~Potato, Onion and Caraway Cloverleaf Rolls~4302~735~121~166~73~5181~500~Potatoes lend moistness, and caraway seeds and onions--two ingredients favored by German, Scandinavian and Eastern European immigrants--add flavor to these traditionally shaped rolls.
5014607~Cranberry Pineapple Salsa~183~12~10~0~14~0~0~Cranberries might seem out of place in a salsa, but their zesty crunch anchors this mix of roasted pineapple, onion, and cilantro. Besides, what would Thanksgiving be without cranberries?

5014616~Linguine with Shrimp and Asparagus~3423~354~49~152~141~4649~1324~Highly recommended!
5014617~Pistachio Dark-Chocolate Crisps~2211~219~151~51~147~307~229~This variation on spice cookies will beguile with its unlikely ingredients: A little curry powder provides an unplaceable base note for flat brown-sugar tuiles studded with pistachios and chocolate chunks.

5014625~Cedar-Planked Char with Wood-Grilled Onions~206~23~11~21~3~1307~0~Small whole fish like trout, char, walleye, bass, and even lake perch are excellent for planking, especially smoke-planking. They get the flavor of the wood plank on one side and a burnished golden color and smoky flavor on the other. An indirect fire is used to slowly cook the whole fish through. Char, in flavor and texture a cross between trout and salmon, is best planked whole. It's easier to fillet after it is cooked and stays moister that way. This method can be used with fish fillets and steaks, too. Whenever you grill fish, grill lemon halves alongside. The little bit of browning adds flavor, and the heat makes the lemons burst with juice.

5014785~Chicken and Vegetable Quesadilla~1773~230~138~59~68~3026~202~For this dish, I recommend using leftover chicken or a pre-roasted chicken from the supermarket.
5014786~Aligot Gratin~4740~657~136~192~150~20851~360~In France puréed potatoes are mixed with a local cow's-milk cheese known as Tomme Fraîche de Cantal. We've substituted fresh mozzarella — widely available in the States — to give the dish a similar consistency.
5014787~Eggplant and Smoked-Gouda Open-Faced Grilled Sandwiches~605~69~13~23~26~2818~89~The components of these sandwiches are relatively straightforward, but the results are a revelation. And with gooey melted cheese, tender slabs of eggplant, and a bright tomato-parsley salsa, they're a wonderful main course option for vegetarians and meat eaters alike.
5014788~Chestnut, Wild Rice, and Pistachio Dressing~3489~505~65~66~144~5272~189~Between the rich chestnuts and the buttery rice, this dish has the chops to be a main.
5014789~Ham and Egg Strata~2739~190~128~185~141~11896~906~A wonderful brunch dish. You will need to begin preparing it a day before serving.
5014790~Peach Sabayon with Balsamic Peaches~488~108~104~9~0~4194~4~If you don't have peach brandy on hand, use additional white wine instead.
5014791~A Green Peas Soup, without Meat~9443~1304~87~351~216~16006~126~This Mary Kettilby recipe produces a classic Potage St. Germain. The name comes from the Paris suburb of St.-Germain-en-Laye, where young peas, a rarity in the early eighteenth century, were sown in boxes for early-spring cultivation. The addition of onions and spinach provide a traditional French touch, making this soup a flavorsome beginning for spring menu.

5014798~Smoked Oyster Caesar~3585~266~8~64~238~11169~63~I get a lot of inspiration from staring at the supermarket shelves, and seeing what items are grouped together. I made this recipe because I found the smoked oysters next to the anchovies in the canned fish section and decided to try them out instead in my Caesar dressing. Once I did that, I decided to riff on the croutons a bit too. In this recipe, the smoky oysters complement the rich egg yolks, which in turn get cut by a healthy dose of lemon juice. Do you like other canned fishies? All are good Caesar salad material, providing they are packed in oil, which amps up their flavor almost to a condiment level of oomph. If you want to get real crazy, find the canned seafood section in an ethnic market.
5014799~Hazelnut Meringues with Lemon Cream and Blood Orange Syrup~5561~637~503~81~298~547~881~"""To celebrate my recent promotion, my sister treated me to dinner at Radius here in Boston,"" says Jill Thompson, Boston, Massachusetts. The dessert we shared was unforgettable—a hazelnut meringue concoction made by pastry chef Paul Connors. As we polished it off, my sister and I agreed that we had found the city’s best new restaurant."""

The seasoning mixture here is simple, with spices you should already have on your shelf and you can play around, adding fresh or dried mint, grated onion, or a pinch of cinnamon. And if you like a garlicky yogurt sauce, by all means, add a minced clove.

Uncork an Italian Barbera to match the menu's hearty flavors.

5014816~Sorrel-Wrapped Goat Cheese and Beet Stacks~539~9~5~0~55~1375~0~If you can't get sorrel at your local market, arugula leaves or large basil leaves are a good alternative.
5014817~Chive Tartines with Smoked Salmon~1892~10~4~40~197~1036~139~In France, tartines are slices of bread topped with butter and sometimes cheese, honey, or other spreads. Here that simple idea is turned into a sophisticated appetizer when the bread is brushed with chive oil and topped with smoked salmon and goat cheese.
5014818~Chicken in Lemongrass Sauce~1743~173~72~150~39~11087~306~Serve rice with this dish from Le Colonial, a Vietnamese restaurant in West Hollywood.

5014831~Stuffing Fried Rice~3817~763~0~82~44~239~4~For this carb-on-carb fried rice recipe, you can use anything but boxed stuffing (the texture is too fine and will turn to mush). We chose a cornbread and chorizo stuffing, which can handle being cooked again and tossed in the stir-fry.
5017091~Blue Cheese Dressing~489~21~6~25~29~1836~126~When I was a single gal in NYC and my parents lived in Westchester, we used to meet almost halfway for dinner at Gus's in Harrison, new york. It is a great bar serving delicious seafood and their salad was my favorite—red wine vinaigrette with big hunks of blue cheese. We were always a blue cheese—loving family and my version, with a creamy base (can't compete with Gus!), is fantastic on a wedge of iceberg lettuce or as a dip. It lasts for a good week in the fridge as well.
5015731~White Kimchi~625~144~67~10~0~41672~0~It's hard to overstate the importance of kimchi, which is typically a spicy dish of fermented firm leafy cabbage and other vegetables. This mild version omits chilies. Begin making it at least three days ahead.

5014838~Coffee-Rubbed Cheeseburgers with Texas Barbecue Sauce~2931~64~29~241~195~6360~800~Freshly ground coffee adds a depth to the spice rub and brings out the flavor of the meat. Be sure to keep the rub recipe handy. The spice rub would also be great on steaks and chicken.
5014840~Chocolate-Amaretto Souffles~2297~219~194~33~141~762~355~Highly recommended!
5014841~Rice Pudding with Persimmons and Dried Cranberries~1537~292~262~27~27~1318~99~Hachiya persimmon puree flavors the pudding; using arborio (the starchy, short-grained risotto rice) gives it an especially tender, creamy texture.
5014842~Meatballs with Bulgur in Onion and Tomato Sauce (Voli Me Plyguri)~1354~176~120~42~32~5190~109~Voli are marbles, the multicolored little balls that were so popular with kids during my childhood. But unlike the glass versions, which were quite expensive, the ones we used to play with were made of clay and colored in various bright, glossy shades. They were fragile, and their glaze would crack, revealing their dark red insides, similar in color to these delicious meatballs with bulgur.
5014843~Swiss Chard with Raisins and Pine Nuts~1659~101~57~31~140~2128~0~Highly recommended!
5014844~Strawberry-Rhubarb Semifreddo~3358~119~50~42~311~540~1028~A semifreddo is a frozen, molded mousse. Here, we combine it with a walnut-shortbread crust for a tart that celebrates the coming of spring fruit.
5014845~Plum Oatmeal Crisp~1646~213~102~24~79~2~94~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5014846~Potato Chip–Crusted Magic Bars~3137~195~97~74~239~1680~126~Whether you call them magic bars or seven-layer (or sometimes five-layer) cookies, you probably know these treats. Chunky bits—like chocolate chips, nuts, and coconut—get layered over sticky condensed milk and a crisp cookie crust. The bars are perfect for potlucks because they're portable and super-easy to make. The problem is (for me!) that they're always way too sweet. In this version, you'll find a potato-chip crust, unsweetened coconut flakes, and salted smoked almonds. The bars are just as chewy, crunchy, and appealing as the usual but taste less sugary.
5014847~Fish and Vegetable Soup with Lime, Ginger, and Cilantro~788~105~42~21~30~3378~8~Highly recommended!
5014848~Raspberry Coconut Squares~3619~696~494~95~106~715~954~Highly recommended!

5014852~Thai-Style Beef and Asparagus Curry~1077~13~3~101~63~670~345~Serve this intensely flavored curry — made with Thai red curry paste and coconut milk from the supermarket's Asian foods section — over steamed jasmine rice. A side salad of bean sprouts drizzled with Asian salad dressing would be a cooling accompaniment; follow it with mango slices.
5014853~Roasted Mustard Tarragon Chicken~442~18~3~19~38~1175~140~Slathering mustard on chicken is one easy way to a juicy, flavorful bird. Like its creator, Ruth Cousineau, this dish revels in simplicity without being austere: Gild the lily by making a delectably creamy, mustardy gravy from the pan juices. The gravy, in turn, begs for mashed potatoes, and by adding a salad—voilà, the perfect Sunday dinner. (Editor's note: This recipe is solely the creation of Ruth Cousineau and has not been formally tested by the test kitchen.)
5014854~Red Wine-Braised Chicken With Chorizo and Chickpeas~1863~111~94~102~110~7192~325~Crispy bits of chorizo, tender chickpeas, and a splash of Sherry vinegar give this simple weeknight braise a decidedly Spanish vibe and hearty bite.

5014858~Pasta with Goat Cheese, Lemon, and Asparagus~2502~346~10~80~84~2206~71~Don't be tempted to buy precrumbled goat cheese, despite the time savings—it won't melt as well.
5014859~Cantaloupe and Grape Compote~730~149~133~2~0~1516~0~Highly recommended!
5014861~Deviled Eggs with Sun-Dried Tomatoes and Chives~419~26~5~17~23~1538~370~Here's a nice way to use up those leftover hard-boiled Easter eggs.
5014862~Spinach Risotto~1673~214~15~64~71~6126~118~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5014863~Leafy No-Lettuce Salad~4481~251~79~168~316~9656~210~There's so much more to leafy greens than lettuce. Here, they're tossed with a light vinaigrette and spooned over sliced stone fruit, nuts, and blue cheese.
5014864~Steak with Mustard and Green Peppercorns~346~16~12~0~23~961~70~The Kitchen Conservatory, a popular St. Louis cooking school, knows how the superb beef of the Midwest should be cooked. Suitable accompaniments are baked potatoes, steamed carrots and a green salad. Complete the meal with a pear tart.

5014871~Whole Wheat Bread with Raisins and Walnuts~6431~977~144~152~213~9385~154~Highly recommended!
5014872~Mussels in Carrot Ginger Broth~1677~58~41~198~61~3765~640~This colorful one-pot main dish meshes savory mussels with Asian aromatics for a contemporary take on moules marinière. Bottled fresh carrot juice is a flavorful (and not-to-be-sniffed-at) shortcut.
5014873~Celery and Jícama Sauté~461~42~3~0~28~1977~0~This slightly unusual side dish takes the place of your standard green beans, lending a light and crunchy contrast to the heavier, puréed dishes in this menu. (Most people don't think of cooking jicama, but we love its crisp water-chestnut-like texture, raw or sautéed.)
5014874~Opera~259~86~0~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5014875~Mustard Tarragon Butter~714~0~0~0~78~406~214~This butter is delicious on grilled fish or roast chicken, and will keep, chilled, up to 1 week, or frozen up to 1 month.

5014878~Supper Clam Chowder~3701~593~160~106~88~18099~171~Here's a zesty, colorful-and lighter version of clam chowder that brings new life to an old favorite. Accompany the chowder with a salad of lettuce, carrots and pickled beets; the muffins; and beer or lemonade. Purchased apple pie with cheddar cheese makes a terrific finale.
5014880~Pomegranate-Glazed Eggplant~790~107~60~4~34~947~0~Eggplant can take its time getting tender in the oven, but it's worth it, especially for preparations like this, where za'atar, with its earthy flavor, and sweet-tart pomegranate molasses turn things toward the Middle East. You can find both in Middle Eastern markets; za'atar can be had at good spice stores such as Penzeys. Or substitute 1 teaspoon of dried thyme or oregano, a squeeze of lemon, and 1 teaspoon of sesame seeds.
5018724~Buttermilk Doughnuts~4354~748~334~88~46~4459~370~This recipe is an accompaniment for Mocha Custards with Buttermilk Doughnuts .

5017266~Corn and Avocado Relish~1137~208~144~12~26~5849~0~Highly recommended!
5014901~Sour Cream Biscuits With Sausage Gravy~2401~317~83~162~114~6151~330~Repeatedly folding and rolling the biscuit dough yields lots of flaky, individuated layers that pull apart neatly when you eat them.
5014902~Smoked Black Bass~843~107~56~5~44~3143~10~It's always exciting to find a cooking method that has a dramatic effect on the flavor of your food, and this technique certainly fits the bill. Black bass, liberally seasoned with garlic, olive oil, and lime, is wrapped in layers of water-soaked paper, then buried under hot coals.
5014903~Grapefruit Gimlet~290~72~66~0~3~141~2~Pucker up with this refreshing sweet-sour spin on the classic gimlet. Ruby Red grapefruit vodka from Napa Valley stands in for gin, and fresh lime juice adds just the right amount of tartness.
5014904~Walnut Mini-Loaves~1858~137~18~80~139~1956~18~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5014905~Parboiled Rice~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~South Indian rice is parboiled during processing, which creates a more nutritious but harder grain that needs to be boiled like pasta for 40 minutes. The grains are puffy and separate, and they absorb the curries beautifully. Indian parboiled rice can be ordered from iShopIndian.com; but if this type is not available, American-style converted rice or regular long-grain white rice are both good substitutes. (North Indian basmati rice would not be served at a Sadhya.) This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.
5014907~Barbecue Boneless Pork Ribs~1755~86~69~104~114~6486~306~Meaty pork ribs usually take time to prepare and are full of calories. This quick and easy version keeps the flavor but leaves out the fat and the bones.

5014913~Prosciutto-Roasted Halibut with Fresh Thyme~455~3~1~28~30~2117~120~Looking for an elegant entrée to serve on Christmas Eve? You just found it.
5019897~Vanilla Bean Ice Cream~4383~414~412~19~300~610~1341~Depending on the capacity of your ice-cream maker, you may have to freeze the custard in 2 batches.
5014915~Vanilla Panna Cotta with Mixed-Berry Compote~3319~236~236~12~236~17~943~Refrigerate these silky puddings for at least six hours and up to one day before serving.
5014917~Portobello Mushroom Burgers with Basil-Mustard Sauce~1665~58~15~15~168~2500~253~Brushed with garlic oil, grilled over the fire and stacked onto crusty buns with plenty of burger trimmings, portobellos are this season's snazziest alternative sandwich filling.
5014918~Bibb Lettuce with Shrimp, Asparagus, and Chive Aïoli~3915~126~32~116~344~4630~1209~Bibb and Boston are both types of butter lettuce; you can use either in this recipe. What to drink: An Australian Sémillon, or a California Chardonnay or Chenin Blanc will stand up to the rich flavors in this meal.
5014919~Savoy Cabbage, Carrot, and Apple Salad~305~45~38~1~13~78~0~The homey and hearty dishes of Louis Szathmáry—a splendidly mustached man who was the chef-owner of Chicago's well-known Hungarian restaurant The Bakery—are the inspiration for this dinner. Of course, chef Louis cooked using lots of butter and cream, but with just a touch of fat we've retained many of the same earthy flavors that he loved.
5014920~Balsamic and Tomato Roast Chicken~472~47~35~21~19~1817~45~Highly recommended!
5014921~Seafood en Brodo with Tarragon Pesto~3090~219~20~108~207~11041~250~Most fish markets will sell you the bones you need to make the rich broth, but avoid those from oily fish like mackerel or bluefish, which will overpower the stew's flavor.
5014922~Golden and Long Beet Salad with Roquefort~651~26~13~13~58~1943~59~The contrasting colors of these two beets are especially attractive in this dish but you may substitute any others.
5014923~Linguine and Zucchini with Bagna Cauda Sauce~5959~742~246~115~288~3304~760~Highly recommended!
5015172~Mexican Pineapple Salad~523~36~12~1~42~400~0~Juicy pineapple meets creamy avocado, crisp jicama, and red onion in a refreshing salad that goes especially well with the cilantro-chipotle tilapia .
5014925~Chinese Trinidadian Stir-Fried Shrimp with Rum~1112~119~76~112~35~4331~880~"When I was in Trinidad, Winnie Lee Lum showed me how to make this superb dish, which beautifully demonstrates the convergence of Chinese and Trinidadian cooking traditions. Of course, the taste was extraordinary because Lee Lum only cooks with fresh local shrimp that her husband, Tony, purchases for her. Before cooking, she rinses the shrimp in lime juice, a Trinidadian cooking practice said to remove the ""fishy"" taste. She prefers the Chinese custom of cooking the shrimp in the shell to protect the shrimp's succulence and flavor. Rather than rice wine, Lee Lum insists on using dark Jamaican-style rum; according to her, white rum is too harsh for cooking. This is one of the easiest dishes to stir-fry, and it is guaranteed to satisfy."

5014929~German-Style Potato and Ham Salad~6154~1066~233~162~130~37599~165~This salad is no bland picnic side dish: Slices of deli ham and bits of salty bacon give it hearty main-course appeal.
5014930~Shrimp and Watermelon Salad~1419~29~18~21~139~1440~194~To round out the meal: a whole-wheat roll with 1 tsp butter or trans-fat-free soft-tub margarine; 4 oz white wine or juice spritzer; 2 gingersnaps

5014935~Whole Wheat Pancakes with Bananas and Pecans~4981~608~253~84~261~7201~552~Amber likes to serve these pancakes for brunch. Diced fresh pineapple would be a delicious alternative to the bananas.
5014936~Skewered Scallops with Orange-Sesame Dipping Sauce~854~87~49~19~43~819~31~Fresh mint, cilantro sprigs and strips of orange peel make a nice garnish for a platter of these Asian-accented skewers.

5019061~Vanilla Snack Cakes~909~160~60~60~29~1892~8~Despite some tall tales, Hostess Twinkies do not last forever. The box of Twinkies that my friends gave me as a gag gift were, in fact, hard as a rock in less than a year. These cream-filled chiffon cake snacks, made with real, unprocessed dairy and eggs and whole-grain flours, won't last nearly as long as preservative-laden Twinkies, but you will almost certainly gobble them up in no time at all.
5014943~Adobo-Rubbed Pork Tenderloin with Black Bean Pico de Gallo~1186~210~130~48~20~56327~54~Saturday dinner. From Red Mountain Spa in St. George, Utah. Give lean pork tenderloin a rubdown with executive chef Jim Gallivan's potent adobo chile mix. The spicy bean salsa topper adds fiber but not a lick of fat.
5014944~Skillet Chicken Pot Pie With Butternut Squash~1632~160~15~46~99~4019~66~Lay the puff pastry over the skillet for a pretty look. Use any brand; the weight may vary, but either way you'll have enough to work with.
5014946~Smoked Duck and Walnuts with Winter Greens~403~35~27~0~27~143~0~Smoked duck adds elegance to this salad. Smoked turkey would also work well.

5014948~Cranberry Tangerine Conserve~1579~380~314~2~0~29~0~Throw everything in the pan, and voilà! Cranberry sauce. Its just five ingredients simmering on the stove, but it tastes beguilingly complex. Tangerine juice and zest, fresh ginger, and plump golden raisins add a citrusy, spicy sweetness to tart, bursting cranberries.
5014949~Ladyfinger~308~93~7~0~3~11~1~Highly recommended!
5014950~Spiced Roast Goose with Dried-Fruit Pan Sauce~1721~246~138~9~78~106~214~Highly recommended!
5014951~Aztec Sluggers~1104~79~57~28~80~1117~216~Three great ways to keep warm — coffee, hot chocolate, and bourbon — in a single mug.

5017577~Caramel Cheesecake Bites~151~0~0~12~10~140~370~If you choose to bake only one cookie from this collection, make it these bites. The crisp cookie base provides the perfect contrasting setup to the luscious caramel-flavored dulce de leche—caramelized milk—hidden under the creamiest cheesecake layer. The final snazzy drizzle of dulce de leche is not essential, we know, but it makes the bites downright irresistible.
5014955~Cucumber, Radish, and Tomato Salad with Citrus Dressing~872~73~36~18~58~24550~10~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5014956~Green Garlic and Leek Matzo Brei With Smoked Salmon and Horseradish Cream~1423~93~3~38~99~1505~485~There are two schools of thought when it comes to matzo brei: the softer scrambled eggs style and the firmer frittata style. My family prefers the latter, and we usually think of matzo brei as a Passover version of French toast, eating it with maple syrup and a sprinkle of salt for breakfast or a light supper. But sometimes I turn this humble dish into an elegant savory main course that incorporates the delicate young green garlic and leeks sold at farmers’ markets this time of year. Topped with silky smoked salmon and horseradish-spiked crème fraîche, this matzo brei is too beautiful to serve only during the eight days of Passover.
5014958~Miniature Crab Cakes with Mustard Mayonnaise~1929~34~4~129~139~3463~766~For a particularly light and crunchy coating we used panko (coarse Japanese bread crumbs) on these crab cakes rather than regular bread crumbs. Panko is increasingly available in this country, not only in Asian markets but also in seafood shops.
5019777~Butter Braised Oysters on Greens~1434~90~9~69~84~1877~181~Oysters are a great way to start any meal, but buttered on toast they are ideal winter comfort food.

5014963~Winter Dried Fruit and Nut Chocolate Bark~467~53~33~6~33~0~0~Any combination of dried fruit and nuts will work here, so choose your favorites or just use what you have in your cupboard. For a sweeter treat, swap in semisweet chocolate chips in place of bittersweet.
5014964~Mint Julep Spritzer~1689~274~185~67~38~1994~210~For anyone born in the Bluegrass State, the mint julep has a special significance: It's traditionally served on Kentucky Derby Day, the first Saturday in May. But it makes a great cocktail for any warm-weather afternoon. We've added a splash of club soda to make the drink a little lighter and more refreshing.
5016799~Cucumber and Radish Salad~1538~119~106~50~100~6486~241~"Michael Lindley, Public House, Chattanooga: ""Cucumbers are great in picnic food, something you can take with you anywhere."""
5014968~Apricot Pear Cordials~4685~1140~919~17~0~34~0~Look for 1-quart cordial bottles, carafes, or mason jars with necks wide enough for adding the fruit (and removing it, if desired, after the liqueur has matured). You may need slightly more or less fruit, vodka, and rock candy, depending on the size of the containers.
5014969~Maple Crème Caramel~2675~355~352~21~121~522~493~Highly recommended!
5014971~Vegetables Glazed with Balsamic Vinegar~1299~163~42~26~59~3274~44~Highly recommended!
5014972~Chicken Laap~1188~90~0~108~41~4240~263~This very typical Lao dish may also be made with fish, pork, beef, or, in Southeast Asian tradition, water buffalo meat. While laap is often made with raw meat or fish, our chicken-based rendition is stir-fried, as it was when Lao cooks served it to us. A powder made from toasted glutinous rice subtly flavors the dish.
5014973~Grilled Chicken and Vegetable Sandwiches with Tarragon Mayonnaise~2465~182~44~45~186~2826~278~"Carey Paquette of Arlington, Virginia, writes: ""My boyfriend and I cook almost every night as a way to unwind. It's nice to come home after a hectic day and make dinner together rather than pull something prepackaged out of the freezer. One of our favorite things is grilled vegetables. I'm always adding them to meals, since they don't need a lot of preparation. They're the key ingredients in my popular chicken sandwiches."""
5014974~Grilled Vegetable Salad with Tofu~1751~124~53~30~143~1646~54~One of the perks of fame: getting five-star food without leaving the sofa. Whenever Denise Richards craves a healthy, delicious meal, she calls private chef Dorte Lambert, founder of DL Creations. Don't be put off by the high fat count in this dish; it's mostly the heart-friendly unsaturated kind.

5014980~Goose Stew with Barley and Celery Root~2175~298~31~42~96~3216~47~I originally designed this recipe for wild snow geese, and because many of California's snow geese spend their summers on Wrangel Island, near Siberia, it seemed fitting to give the stew a Russian feel. But of course the legs of any goose or duck, wild or domesticated, will work here.
5014981~Grilled Pork Chops with Anise-Seed Rub and Mango Mojo~614~56~21~0~41~4848~0~Our Cuban-style mango mojo could enhance any grilled meat, as could the anise-seed rub. Adding our grilled asparagus and herbed bulgur creates a well-rounded meal, but rice and green beans or broccoli would also work.

5014988~Blueberry Lemon Crumbles~3972~526~315~138~209~1968~219~These small muffin-shaped cookies deliver a brown-sugar-infused crunch, followed by an intensely fruity burst of blueberries and lemon.
5019094~Marscarpone Cream~1515~63~63~4~128~63~461~Highly recommended!
5014991~Crispy Za'atar Fish with Israeli Couscous, Swiss Chard, and Feta~2359~224~25~59~128~7205~49~Za'atar is a pre-made spice blend of aromatic dried thyme or oregano, tart sumac, and nutty sesame seeds. Here, it flavors fish fillets served over a warm salad of wilted chard, crisp pomegranate seeds, briny olives, and salty feta.
5014992~Anchovies in Tomato Sauce with Pasta~1261~154~44~59~101~1739~106~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are from Jamie Oliver's book Jamie's Italy.

5014996~Cider-Brined Pork Roast with Potatoes and Onions~5307~1173~967~26~74~97712~54~If you like, you can coat the pork with the coriander and chill it for an extra night before roasting for more flavor. It will also help the pork get a good sear.
5014999~Honey-Cardamom Custards with Strawberry-Orange Compote~864~88~75~33~34~864~142~Few desserts are as comforting or satisfying as a simple egg custard. Here we've dressed things up a bit with some extra spice and a fruit compote.
5015000~Blueberry Lemon Corn Muffins~1632~188~22~54~90~1265~232~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5015002~Baked Hawaiian Islands~4510~835~783~24~136~6058~371~Classic baked Alaska is turned on its head with these individual desserts from Elizabeth Falkner of San Francisco's Citizen Cake. Coconut, pineapple, passion fruit, and a rum-soaked sorbet lend a tropical twist. To save time, use store-bought pineapple sorbet.

5015006~Hawaiian~324~98~11~0~0~4~0~Highly recommended!
5015007~Shaved Asparagus with Parmesan Vinaigrette~716~6~3~20~69~823~48~Shaving asparagus with a vegetable peeler transforms the texture of a raw stalk into silky strips. This revelatory technique works well with all kinds of vegetables, from carrots to zucchini.
5015011~Grilled Portobello Burgers with Piquillo Pepper Aïoli and Watercress~1531~151~14~17~87~1754~126~Spain's famous piquillo peppers add a sweet-spicy edge to the aioli. Idiazábal, a smoky sheep's-milk cheese from the Basque region, is great with the portobellos. If you can't find Idiazábal, substitute smoked Gouda.
5015012~Peppercorn Steaks with Bourbon Sauce~341~24~4~8~22~1170~29~Serve with the Double-baked Potatoes and steamed broccoli. What to drink: Cabernet Sauvignon. Have angel food cake with sliced strawberries for dessert.
5015013~Pork Kebabs al Pastor~4256~231~116~272~227~15572~971~A popular taco filling in Mexico, pork al pastor is usually cooked in a huge slab on a vertical rotisserie (like Middle Eastern shawarma) and sliced off to order, so that the outside bits are crisp and golden and the inside is juicy and tender. Cooks often stick an onion or a pineapple on top of the rotisserie so that its juices drip down over the well-seasoned meat. Pineapple takes a more central role in this grilled version: The puréed fruit sweetens the basting sauce, while chunks of it join the pork and onion on the skewers. A homemade salsa and an array of accompaniments invite guests to get in on the action.
5015014~Croutes au Fromage~2612~160~0~175~196~1937~591~(Cheese Pastries)

5015033~Roasted Red Curry Chicken with Apple Jus~2848~398~334~13~112~1830~528~Offer this dish with chutney and basmati rice enhanced with dried fruits and yogurt. Jus usually refers to the juice from cooked meat, but the term can also apply to the juice pressed from raw fruit.
5015034~Sauteed Turbot with Braised Endive, Celery Root Flan, Black Truffles, and Garlic Nage~2864~128~94~38~244~52816~675~"Neal Fraser, Executive Chef and co-owner of Grace and BLD in Los Angeles, shared this recipe with Epicurious. The dish is perfect for entertaining, since the endive and celery root flans can be made ahead and reheated. The garlic nage should be made shortly before serving and kept warm while you quickly sear the turbot. A shaving of earthy black truffles finishes the dish. ""Grating them on top makes them soft and allows their perfume to stand out,"" says Fraser."
5015035~Celery Root Bisque with Thyme Croutons~777~27~15~4~67~4400~204~Celery root (also called celeriac) is one of autumn's most delicious—but least appreciated—vegetables. Here it adds fresh celery flavor to this velvety first-course soup.
5015037~Cream Puffs with Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Sauce~3481~380~213~68~204~391~882~Profiteroles

5015040~Chicken with Coconut Curry Sauce~245~10~5~21~13~875~45~Any brand of curry paste, which comes in jars or plastic pouches, will be successful in this authentic-tasting curry. Serve the spicy chicken with rice pilaf and stir-fried broccoli; lemon frozen yogurt is a refreshing finale.
5015041~Vegetable and Chicken Curry~6306~802~191~245~218~23857~333~This Cambodian curry is traditionally made with beef, but Mao Sokhen says his American friends prefer the chicken variation. Though you can use any brand of Thai red curry paste and Asian fish sauce for this recipe, Mao likes the brands recommended below because he finds they produce a dish that is closer to classic Cambodian flavor.
5015042~Spicy Dill Pickles~663~164~118~1~3~12447~0~Highly recommended!
5015043~Tangy Avocado-Orange Salad~283~37~24~1~15~413~0~For a richer version, add a little olive oil.
5015044~Cumin-Crusted Monster Pork Chop with Peach Chipotle Salsa~610~24~21~18~50~4575~50~This Latin-inspired combination of flavors works well with smoky grilled pork, and the crispy cumin crust is complemented by both the heat and sweetness in the salsa. These thick-cut chops taste just as good cold — if there are any left.
5015045~Umeboshi and Rice Salad with Pickled Ginger and Sugar Snap Peas~1756~402~30~40~0~9631~0~Umeboshi, or pickled plums, are not technically plums at all, but apricots. They are mixed with rice to make a popular summer dish in Japan. We've enlivened this salad with pickled ginger and sugar snap peas.
5015047~Broiled Salmon with Apple-Date Chutney~621~59~49~16~34~552~46~Steamed green beans and a rice or pasta salad from the deli go nicely with this entrée inspired by the Pacific Northwest. End with a simple but sophisticated dessert of coffee ice cream drizzled with brandy and sprinkled with toasted hazelnuts.
5015048~Layered Chicken Enchiladas with Tomatillo-Cilantro Sauce~2906~174~34~163~191~5095~621~The tortillas and filling are layered (instead of rolled) to reduce prep time.
5015050~Persian New Year's Soup with Beans, Noodles, and Herbs (Ash-e-reshteh)~2147~241~98~71~100~2784~18~This countrified soup is often served in late March for Norooz, the Persian new year. With beans, vegetables, noodles, and yogurt, it is a meal in itself. If you can't find fava beans, use limas. Start this recipe the night before to soak the chickpeas, kidneys beans, and fava beans.

5015191~Lentil Stew with Spinach and Potatoes~3831~537~49~243~61~146281~0~Reflecting the cuisines of Israel and the surrounding Mediterranean Middle Eastern countries, this meatless stew is seasoned with mint and lemon. Serve it with sesame seed rolls and a tomato and cucumber salad; have pistachio ice cream for dessert.
5015192~Pistachio-Crusted Scallops~507~10~2~21~40~159~94~"""For maximum flavor, I like to toast the nuts until they're almost burnt."""
5015193~Bucatini All'Amatriciana~4072~511~39~169~162~5084~263~It's hard not to love this classic Italian pasta—it's just the right mix of spicy and sweet.

5015195~Applesauce Cake with Penuche Frosting~7766~1672~1347~112~164~3007~453~Highly recommended!
5015196~Red Onion, Parsley, and Preserved Lemon Salad~804~125~69~7~27~14~0~Preserved lemons, sold ready-made in Moroccan souks, are essential to that country's cuisine. The peel, pulp, and juice squeezed from the lemons can all be used. Sometimes, however, the juice and preserving brine, can be bitter; use fresh lemon juice in that case.
5015197~Filets Mignons with Mustard Port Sauce with Red Onion Confit~1483~102~51~56~88~16939~123~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5015199~Dilled Spinach Crepes with Avgolemono Sauce~1436~171~48~82~79~3566~908~Highly recommended!
5015201~Honey-Mustard Chicken-Sausage Kebabs~267~24~22~0~10~2229~15~The chicken sausages are a terrific time-saving ingredient: They're already cooked and full of flavor.
5015202~Soy and Sesame Short Ribs~1137~167~98~16~43~6434~0~Inoue loves to use this marinade on any cut of beef (hanger is another favorite), chicken wings, or pork ribs.
5015203~Kohlrabi Pickles With Chile Oil~223~38~4~0~3~2181~0~Kohlrabi has a muted flavor and crunchy texture similar to a broccoli stem, which is something to keep in mind for this pickles recipe.
5015205~Asparagus with Wasabi-Mayonnaise Dip~1600~31~9~4~168~2864~253~You can substitute wasabi powder for the wasabi paste in this recipe, but we find that the paste imparts a fresher flavor. Force the wasabi powder through a very fine sieve before using.
5015206~Cuban-Style Roast Suckling Pig~167~33~0~0~0~29080~0~In Cuba, this dish is traditionally served on New Year's Day. In this tradition, as in the Hawaiian luau, the pig is usually covered with banana leaves and cooked over a coal fire in a pit that's dug in the backyard. Because this method is not easy to do at home, the recipe below uses a small suckling pig that will fit in the oven, yet deliver the same delicious flavor. Ask your butcher to split the pig for you. Don't be afraid to give this recipe a try — cooking a whole small pig is like cooking a whole turkey.
5017247~Meringue-Topped Raspberry and Peach Ice Cream Cake~7762~1163~812~90~296~4749~883~Spectacular but easy, thanks to purchased ice cream and sorbet. The meringue is browned in the broiler, like a baked Alaska, just before serving.

5015217~Southeast Asian Squid Salad~2106~286~179~40~96~5741~27~Lightly blanched squid makes a simple and elegant salad with the tang of fish sauce and fresh lime juice.
5015218~Panettone Bread and Butter Pudding~2032~302~254~51~68~1067~609~This bread and butter pudding gets its Italian flavor from panettone, a Milanese egg bread studded with raisins and candied fruit. Long a Christmastime specialty, panettone is becoming increasingly available throughout the year not only in Italy but also in the United States.
5015219~Beets with Goat Cheese, Nigella Seeds, and Pistachios~586~40~26~28~37~1544~79~Steaming is back! The vinegar-and-spice-infused liquid flavors the beets as they cook.
5015220~Cinnamon-Walnut Coffee Cake~3783~309~303~59~205~217~133~Bisquick got its start in the early thirties when Carl Smith, a salesman for General Mills, took a late-night train ride. He went to the dining car in hopes of finding something to eat, and was pleasantly surprised to be served freshly made biscuits. When he asked about them, the chef confessed that he kept a pre-mixed batch of ingredients for the dough in the freezer for late orders. Smith reported back to General Mills, suggesting that they market such a mix, and they did. But it’s not just for biscuits; Bisquick can be used to make pancakes and waffles, and this luscious coffee cake, too.
5018587~Ultimate Turkey Stock~270~45~28~14~5~9203~0~Highly recommended!
5015223~Apple and Nut-Butter Puff Pastry Tarts~1026~92~67~9~69~575~193~The flavors of apples dipped in peanut butter, all cozied up inside a flaky puff pastry crust. Sold!

5015225~Fresh Fennel and Arugula With Meyer Lemon Dressing~1016~50~32~26~82~265~0~I love crunchy fennel and peppery arugula dressed with a slightly sweet dressing made from Meyer lemons—a fresh-tasting pick-me-up. Meyer lemons are only available in the wintertime, so if you can’t find them, use regular lemon juice and replace a third of it with fresh orange juice.
5015226~Frozen Iced Coffee With Coffee Jelly~2225~307~211~45~93~5478~313~This sweet and refreshing drink features layers of chocolatey coffee slushie, vanilla whipped cream, and coffee jelly (think coffee jell-o).
5015227~Paniolo Rack of Lamb~870~122~107~6~36~4323~0~"Because the lamb in this recipe is marinated in a barbecue-style sauce and then grilled, the hotel nicknamed the dish ""paniolo"", which means ""cowboy"" in hawaiian."
5015229~Potato Parsnip Mash~497~92~19~8~8~5140~21~Highly recommended!
5015230~Salt-Crusted Beets with Horseradish Crème Fraîche~1020~24~23~8~92~187217~338~Here's a great new way to roast beets: in a salt crust. The horseradish, thyme, and orange in the crust infuse the beets with bright flavor as they're cooking. Leftover beets make a great addition to salads. Lightly coat torn butter lettuce with a Sherry wine vinaigrette, top with the sliced beets and some sliced red onion, and drizzle with a bit of the horseradish crème fraîche.
5015231~Black and White Crème Brûlée~2939~68~52~16~265~419~969~Highly recommended!
5015232~Lemon, Sage, and Garlic Roast Chicken~592~44~7~18~30~2238~45~Have some roasted potatoes and broccoli on the side, then finish with decadent slices of chocolate layer cake.
5015233~Lobster, Scallops, and Mussels with Tomato Garlic Vinaigrette~1752~83~21~241~26~3963~637~You could hardly do better in summer than to combine shellfish and tomatoes—their balance of sweet and savory seems to bring out the best in both. Here, the seafood retains its succulence, while its juices combine with the vinaigrette; you'll want to sop up the excess with bread, or at least eat it with a spoon.
5015234~Butter Beans with Butter, Mint, and Lime~1197~222~138~0~34~0~94~Butter beans are among the late-summer treasures in Charleston. For this simple, satisfying side, use the small green kind (or frozen baby lima beans in the off-season).
5015788~Raisin Scones~6882~1028~304~110~227~3273~1063~"""The scones from Bon Bonerie in Cincinnati are moist, light and sweet,"" says John Van Eeckhout of Norfolk, Virginia. ""When I lived in the area, one of my favorite ways to spend a Saturday morning was to read the newspaper in the bakery's adjacent tearoom while enjoying a raisin scone with clotted cream, preserves and a cup of coffee."""
5015236~Blackberry-Gin Fizz~949~124~124~0~0~1200~0~Use the ripest, juiciest blackberries or raspberries for this cocktail.
5015237~Ramp and Walnut Pistou~1376~15~9~8~148~37~0~Roast or grill ramps (technically a wild leek) to bring out their fragrant garlic notes.
5015238~Waffles with Frizzled Ham and Maple-Mustard Cream~1537~70~66~56~110~3772~497~Add a salad and lemon meringue pie.
5015239~Chili-Seasoned Fish Sticks~1154~174~11~35~38~1895~94~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5015241~Warm Almond Cakes With Grapes~2586~189~160~53~187~792~587~We like serving these chewy, moist almond cakes, which are based on the financier, a French pastry, in individual gratin dishes, but the batter can also be baked in a 9-inch glass pie plate for 30 to 35 minutes.
5015242~Mirabelle Ginger Tart~4141~412~365~89~254~1764~188~Highly recommended!

5015245~Northwestern Wild Mushroom Stuffing~3655~341~85~74~206~4479~662~Hazelnuts and wild mushrooms - popular ingredients from Oregon and Washington - add terrific flavor and texture to this sophisticated stuffing.
5015246~Plantain Flatbread With Poached Egg and Honey Drizzle~140~0~0~12~10~140~370~Think of plantains as the sister to the banana. They’re not as sweet, as they contain less sugar. They’re also higher in starch than most fruits, making them perfect for gluten-and grain-free breads. My favorite part of this entire dish is upon serving: The moment you break the egg white just enough for the golden yolk to spill over, the starchy flatbread soaks up every last bit, leaving you with a nice balance of moisture. The egg yolk is rich and bold, with the added bonus of sprinkled salt and drizzled honey—there’s nothing like it.
5015247~Lamb Köfte with Yogurt Sauce and Muhammara~4140~447~273~212~164~19713~744~The Middle East on a flatbread: Turkish meatballs, a tahini-spiked yogurt sauce, and muhammara, a Syrian red pepper spread.
5015248~Assorted Vegetables~183~11~5~4~13~24~0~Highly recommended!
5015250~Rice Pilaf with Pistachios and Golden Raisins~331~42~31~3~16~592~15~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5015251~Pasta with Confit Duck and Savoy Cabbage~786~67~8~25~39~3533~107~If you haven't thought of duck as comfort food before, this will change your mind. Pasta, confit duck, and Savoy cabbage become the perfect cool-weather dinner—rich and succulent without seeming heavy. If you haven't had confit duck before, trust us: It's just as good as you would imagine duck cooked in rendered fat would be.
5015252~Rosemary Citrus Miso-Rubbed Turkey~2175~220~120~34~129~11100~214~"We are happy to announce that Bev Jones has won our November ""Cook the Cover"" contest with her delicious variation on our Miso-Rubbed Turkey with Turkey Gravy."

5015255~Spiced and Steamed Couscous With Brown Butter~3401~549~38~106~81~4706~189~Steam, fluff; steam, fluff. This couscous recipe is time-consuming but worth it.

5015261~Lemon Cloud~1398~244~242~109~0~341~4~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less, but requires additional unattended time.
5015262~Chocolate Profiteroles with Coffee Ice Cream and Bittersweet Chocolate Sauce~1753~180~92~49~116~495~575~Highly recommended!
5015263~Maraschino Cherry Parfaits~8381~1685~1388~119~115~996~141~Don’t feel like making your own maraschino cherries? Luxardo brand, made with Marasca sour cherries, is our jarred go-to. (Skip those gross neon-red ones.)
5015265~Mixed Grill with Cherry Cola Barbecue Sauce~434~6~3~30~25~1617~107~This festive main offers something for everyone—baby back ribs, chicken breasts, and smoked sausages. Be sure to start the dish a few hours ahead. The ribs are slow-cooked for an hour and a half, then are finished on the grill with the chicken and the sausages.
5015266~Shrimp with Ginger-Herb Butter~894~33~0~21~70~794~383~"Kathy Johnson of New Orleans, Louisiana, writes: ""Having lived in one of America's major food cities most of my life, I am no stranger to good eating. As much as my husband, Paul, and I love dining out, we particularly like making meals together at home. Some of our greatest hits have been the easiest and quickest dishes. It seems that the more I cook, the more I realize that big flavor comes not from the time spent in the kitchen, but from the quality of the ingredients."""
5015267~Cranberry Sauce with Cherries, Marsala and Rosemary~1516~388~361~2~0~29~0~"Jeanne Thiel Kelley, a contributing editor at Bon Appétit, says, ""As far back as I can remember, my father has been glazing the holiday ham with Marsala (we always have ham and turkey on Thanksgiving). When I started making the cranberry sauce, I decided to mix in a little Marsala, figuring that the combination would complement the ham nicely. I was right, and the sauce is terrific with turkey, too. Rosemary might seem like an unusual seasoning in this sauce, but for me it's a natural addition. I live in Southern California, and fresh rosemary is just everywhere."""
5015268~Three-Cheese Pizza with Pancetta and Mushrooms~1697~11~0~124~128~3434~481~Highly recommended!
5015269~Molasses-Cured Pork Shoulder Bacon~1776~670~41~0~0~93057~0~Pork shoulder bacon may not get quite as crisp as belly bacon, but it has a great taste and a meaty texture. Even if you have a thermometer for your grill, you'll still need an instant-read — the grill thermometer won't register low enough to monitor the cold-smoking.
5015270~Baked Pecan-Stuffed Nectarines~762~83~75~16~46~463~4~Highly recommended!
5015271~Chicken Sauté with Sherry~3623~129~42~212~281~18252~1033~Highly recommended!

5015274~Mango-Pineapple-Lime Cheesecake with Ginger Crust~2107~454~445~12~33~142~433~A luscious tropical treat enhanced with a delicious crust made of gingersnap cookies and macadamia nuts. Begin preparing this one day before you plan to serve it.
5017093~Aged Sherry-Walnut Vinaigrette~1509~13~6~0~165~2076~0~This is one of my everyday vinaigrettes. The wood aging of the sherry vinegar creates a wonderfully complex flavor that is enhanced by the walnut oil. Sherry vinegar is a little more expensive than red wine vinegar, but it has a higher acidity so you use less. Pair this dressing with strongly flavored salad greens, cheeses, nuts, and seasonal fruits, like in my Seasonal Country Salad.
5015276~Polenta Toasts with Goat Cheese and Fresh Thyme~821~76~10~44~42~5424~139~Made with less water than is used for soft polenta, the firm polenta in this appetizer has a texture like that of dough. Make sure the work surface, rolling pin and cookie cutter are wet — otherwise, the polenta will stick.
5015277~Spiced Pork Tenderloin With Cherry-Thyme Pan Sauce~1652~31~24~106~114~3971~352~Frozen cherries are the star in a vibrant, herby pan sauce that is made while the lightly spiced pork tenderloin rests.
5015278~Mustard-Crusted Pork With Farro and Carrot Salad~2623~212~46~40~119~3832~58~Using a mandoline to slice the carrots turns them into ribbons, and cooking them briefly keeps them from being too crunchy. If you don't have a mandoline, use a vegetable peeler.
5015280~Penne with Pancetta, Sage, and Mushrooms~5773~417~45~270~336~30657~721~Red wine and pancetta add richness to the dish, but good beef broth really takes it to the next level.
5015281~Seafood Stew with Leeks and Garlic~627~59~7~70~6~1985~391~Highly recommended!

5015285~Santori~7692~1076~739~193~415~5210~372~(Apple Walnut Cake)
5015286~Orzo Risotto~2607~410~27~59~77~3513~189~For this lovely side dish, orzo pasta is cooked like risotto.

5015288~Eggplant Salad with Miso Ginger Dressing~805~108~5~46~14~2842~0~Offered at A Pacific Cafe, in Kapaa, on the Hawaiian Island of Kauai.
5015289~Halibut in Chard Leaves with Lemon-Thyme Butter~1279~11~5~22~123~1793~288~For a lighter version, wrap the fish in very large butter lettuce leaves.
5015291~Vietnamese Fried Rice~5211~1014~42~111~76~4059~380~Highly recommended!
5015292~Black-Eyed Pea and Bacon Salad with Mustard Vinaigrette~926~70~39~23~58~1121~10~Highly recommended!
5015293~Hummus Tehina~217~36~1~10~3~5148~0~We love chef Michael Solomonov's hummus all by itself, but it's also an incredible foundation for any seasonal toppings, from harissa-spiced shaved carrots to spiced black-eyed peas to fresh spring peas and pickled onions.
5015295~Rosanne Cash's Potato Salad~6165~1032~205~112~161~33350~559~A classic rendition of the summer favorite. For something a little different, Cash sometimes adds two-thirds cup chopped fresh cilantro and two teaspoons curry powder.

5016935~Ras El Hanout~31~1~1~0~2~1940~0~"Literally ""top of the shop,"" ras el hanout is a Moroccan spice blend that can contain more than 20 ingredients. This streamlined version includes the main spices of the traditional mixture."
5015310~Grilled Fish with Orange-Fennel Salsa~938~65~20~11~69~5334~0~Rockfish is used in this dish at Cashion's Eat Place in Washington, D.C. If you can't find rockfish fillets, substitute sea bass.
5015311~Fresh Tomato Bruschetta~647~116~5~8~6~506~0~It's low in fat and high in lycopene (a potential cancer fighter). Dig in!
5015312~Chocolate Hazelnut Spiced Cookies~4713~656~327~114~223~2827~94~For the moistest, most intense mostaccioli imaginable, Miraglia Eriquez increased the cocoa, hazelnuts, and spices. And these little frosted cookies only get better with age, so feel free to bake them up to four days ahead of when you plan to serve them.
5015839~Red Bell Pepper and Tomato Salad~627~32~7~12~51~776~0~Highly recommended!
5015314~Turkey Osso Buco~3712~310~83~277~135~19483~895~This play on osso buco forgoes veal for the dark meat of turkey legs. A vibrant gremolata made from lemon and orange zest and fresh parsley offsets the richness of the meat.
5015315~Lemon-Nutmeg Custards~1263~8~6~9~118~198~475~Highly recommended!
5015316~Dried Fruit Stewed with Brown Sugar and Vanilla~1324~308~308~4~0~381~0~This fruit keeps for several days in the refrigerator and is delicious for breakfast, too. Any dried fruit works well.

5015319~Broccoli with Garlic and Parmesan Cheese~1021~51~21~79~62~2037~118~For this recipe, Lisa uses broccoli rabe, a type of bitter Italian green. But the everyday supermarket broccoli works fine, too.

5015323~Lamb Shank Ragù with Anson Mills Grits~2079~137~67~305~160~6772~910~"Lee believes that classic dishes are far from being precious artifacts; they are inherently adaptable, and that's what makes them timeless. The starting point here was his ""very Italian"" wine importer, Enrico Battisti, but instead of polenta, Lee uses quick-cooking stone-ground grits from Anson Mills, in Columbia, South Carolina.""They're better than any polenta,"" he says, ""because they're so fresh. I call them hero grits."""

5015325~Maple Cheesecake with Maple-Cranberry Compote~5086~967~674~46~117~7188~559~The key to this deeply flavored cheesecake? Reduced maple syrup. The sweet-tart compote is a delicious—and pretty—accompaniment.
5015971~Steamed Asian White Rice~2498~565~0~52~0~0~0~Long-grain rice won't do the trick here; short- and medium-grain have the perfect texture for the clay-pot chicken, not quite absorbing the sauce but supporting it in a delicious way.

5015340~Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Buttermilk Slaw and Herbed Mayo~3585~314~82~110~147~3948~621~This crispy sandwich gets a double hit of heat, thanks to a tangy Tabasco sauce brine and cayenne-spiked coating. A crisp buttermilk slaw and creamy herbed mayo spread provide refreshing flavor and a perfect counterbalance to the spice.
5015341~Crisp Chocolate Marshmallow Squares~4743~660~173~140~187~3989~342~Who doesn't love Rice Krispies treats? By adding dark chocolate ganache with a tiny jolt of coffee flavor, we've turned the classic into a sophisticated and whimsical bite-size dessert. We found that combining bittersweet chocolate of different cacao levels results in a ganache that has just the right intensity without being overpowering.
5015342~Spring Vegetable Ragoût with Fresh Chervil~971~86~33~18~64~1303~0~Chervil's delicate anise flavor enhances the season's baby vegetables. If you don't have chervil, substitute fresh dill.

5015346~Potato Pancakes with Confit Duck and Red-Cabbage Beet Slaw~2511~249~56~48~146~4790~80~Replacing this Czech dish's traditional pork stuffing with confit duck results in a much shorter cooking time without sacrificing any mouthwatering flavor.
5015347~Curried Chicken~3610~199~87~379~128~14061~898~Serve the curry with steamed white rice and Indian beer, and make a stop at an Indian restaurant to get some samosas — savory filled pastries — to pass as appetizers, and the flatbread called naan to sop up the curry sauce. For dessert, how about assorted teas and a carrot cake?
5015348~White Wine and Peach Sangria~1306~284~274~2~0~16675~0~Highly recommended!
5015349~Milk Pie~3096~370~139~89~131~2614~726~Galatopita, or milk pie, has a crisp phyllo crust and a dense, satisfying custard filling made with semolina flour. It is among the dairy specialties of Epirus and Thessaly; we like this version from Ioannina.
5015350~Grilled Skirt Steak Tacos with Roasted Poblano Rajas~883~49~6~84~31~2705~217~Tacos de Arrachera al Carbón con Rajas
5016490~Roasted Beet Salad with Flash-Pickled Radishes and Chard~839~22~14~13~81~757~39~Because beets are sweet and earthy, they need a good helping of acidity and salt to brighten them up. Immediately after cooking, dress beets in vinaigrette and salt to let them marinate. Blue cheese or crème fraîche offer sufficient tang for this salad if goat cheese is not available. If you are following our $68 Dinner Story, reserve the greens from the beets and the remaining Swiss chard stems and greens for the Sautéed Greens with Walnuts . Buy a bunch of radishes and save the rest for the Carrot and Radish Salad with Tuna and Capers .
5019709~Beet Risotto~2092~297~11~36~86~8456~177~This is an elegant risotto that's fairly straightforward, though a bit messy if you're using red beets. Yellow or red, the color is spectacular and the taste will have those averse to eating beets rethinking the root. If you are following our $68 Dinner Story, reserve the greens from the beets for the Fettuccine with Asparagus, Beet Green Pesto, and Poached Egg .

It's not as heavy as some other whole grains, but it's still packed with protein, fiber, magnesium, and vitamins A, B, C, and E. Here, it's the base for a satisfying summer salad.
5015358~Tomales Bay Oysters Rockefellar~2090~118~21~61~144~2327~393~Make the filling ahead of time and you'll need only a few minutes to go from shucking to eating.
5015359~Parmesan Shortbread with Fennel and Sea Salt~3806~322~118~163~271~3270~700~Any salty hard cheese, such as an aged Manchego, Grana Padano, or Mimolette, would be a fine substitute for the Parmesan. This recipe is from Caitlin Williams Freeman's upcoming cookbook, The Blue Bottle Craft of Coffee.

5015365~Potato Salad with 7-Minute Eggs and Mustard Vinaigrette~4271~866~190~96~32~25913~370~Egg salad and potato salad: Unite! We like how the still-soft yolks dress the salad, but you can cook the eggs a minute or two longer if you like them more set.

5015369~Burnt Carrots with Goat Cheese, Parsley, Arugula, and Crispy Garlic Chips~482~16~13~33~36~1006~119~"Carrots are like a quiet but secretly remarkable child who doesn't attract much attention. Most often they're simply what you throw into a soup or a braised dish to ""add a little sweetness."" But it's because of that inner sweetness that they're so suited to charring on a chapa. The sugar caramelizes and produces a delicious crust. They are tossed with nutty garlic chips, peppery arugula, and creamy goat cheese."
5015370~Fettuccine with Chicken, Red Onion and Peppers~5360~355~8~161~329~3322~1053~Highly recommended!

5015375~Beef Brisket Braised with Dried Fruit, Yams and Carrots~4127~578~291~122~133~8558~331~This can be prepared one day ahead, making the seder day much easier. Serve steamed broccoli on the side.

5015391~Linguine with Garlic Shrimp and Basil~3051~284~9~189~122~2903~1667~"Lauren Beal of San Rafael, California, writes: ""When it comes to making dinner, my husband, Stuart, and I have the perfect system. He's in charge of our backyard garden, and I'm in charge of cooking with what he harvests — things like basil, onions, lemons, and even apples. It's our favorite way to create a meal together."""
5015392~California Barley Bowl with Lemony Yogurt Sauce~562~23~4~14~47~1146~0~If you grew up in Northern California in the 1990s, you lived through the trend that was sprouts. From alfalfa sprouts to bean sprouts, they seemed to find their way into every green salad, sandwich, and omelet. This savory whole-grain breakfast bowl is inspired by those California days, with chunks of ripe avocado, crumbled Cotija cheese, toasty almonds, and a citrus-sparked yogurt sauce. While alfalfa sprouts were prevalent when I was growing up, today I try to branch out, using a tangle of colorful bean sprouts or more delicate radish or sunflower sprouts. These morning bowls couldn't be easier to prepare, but the barley does take a while to cook; I put a pot on the stove first thing in the morning so it'll be ready by the time I've had my coffee and prepped the other ingredients. Feel free to experiment with other grains, too. I've tried this with both quinoa and farro, and it's as wonderful with delicate grains as it is with heartier ones.
5015393~Farfalle with Tuna and Rosemary Mushroom Sauce~1325~190~13~51~25~2570~70~Tuna and 'shrooms contain two different umami compounds that work synergistically to enhance the savory flavor. This dish is the lightest of this noodly bunch, with only 350 calories per bowl.
5015394~Passion Fruit “Crumble”~1139~193~131~13~37~528~0~This is such a sweet little dessert. As you know, I’m not one for sweet treats but this is a little pop of yumminess—perfect for dinner parties, and it won’t leave your guests rolling around on the floor with indigestion.
5015395~Mexican Floating Island with Kahlua Custard Sauce and Sesame Pumpkin-Seed Brittle~4119~833~808~48~81~968~249~Highly recommended!
5015396~Spice-Rubbed Pork Tenderloin With Roasted Baby Carrots~894~121~56~10~37~3221~31~"Pork tenderloin goes perfectly with sweet baby carrots. The bags of machine-cut ""baby"" carrots contain too much moisture and wont roast nicely. Instead, use true baby carrots or larger carrots cut into long, slender fingers about the size of young carrots."
5015398~Blueberry-Lemon Icebox Cake~4087~349~277~21~307~944~1573~The more particular you are when building the layers in the loaf pan, the more neat and tidy this will look when sliced. But if it’s a little uneven and the layers blend together, so be it!
5015399~Crunchy Chicken Salad with Shiitake Mushrooms, Spicy Sesame Dressing and Peanuts~2241~201~13~83~119~2486~46~Cabbage, cucumbers, carrots, and lots of fresh mint accent the salad. Offer chilled beer or a fruity white wine alongside.

5015405~Potato and Carrot Gratin Diamonds~3861~615~174~74~121~13849~712~Highly recommended!
5015407~Indian-Spiced Pickled Vegetables~507~76~58~5~12~484~17~We typically think of pickling as involving mainly vinegar or, as is the case with kimchi, a fermenting process. In India, however, oil is the secret ingredient, employed to carry the flavor of spices. Here, mustard seeds and ground turmeric bring brightness to the mix.
5015408~Grilled Pork Chops with Sweet Lemongrass Marinade~924~206~189~21~3~76~69~This flavorful lemongrass marinade is pretty common in Vietnam, where it's used on thin pork chops that are quickly grilled over a hot fire. Because the marinade has a lot of sugar, grilling the meat is the only way to go. If you try to pan-fry the pork chops, the sugar will burn before the meat is cooked through.

Only half of the pesto is used for this recipe; toss the remainder with pasta or spread thinly on crostini or grilled chicken breasts. What to drink: Pinot Grigio.
5015425~Apple and Cranberry Crisps with Ginger-Pecan Topping~1473~331~213~13~3~484~0~This recipe can be doubled and baked in a 13x9x2-inch baking dish.

5015427~Marmalade Cake~5105~948~641~67~127~1856~693~This citrus cake is decorated with thin slices of candied orange peel. If you have any left over, roll them in sugar and dip in melted icing for a sweet treat.

Warren of Lake Forest, Illinois, writes: ""I have often indulged in Jay Lovell's phenomenal cuisine at his Lovell's of Lake Forest restaurant, and the ribs he prepared for an event I attended were out of this world. Could you possibly persuade the chef to share the recipe?"""
5015429~Steamed Mussels with Tomato and Chorizo Broth~2603~102~14~282~92~6154~902~Don't Move a Mussel—Seriously—this one-pot dinner is that easy. Sweet cherry tomatoes, earthy chorizo, and a splash of wine do the heavy lifting.

5015431~Grilled Artichokes with Olive Oil, Lemon, and Mint~214~45~3~3~0~96~0~If the grill is large enough, cook the artichokes alongside the steaks; otherwise, grill these first and serve at room temperature.

5015434~Trout with Tropical Fruit Salsa and Mixed Greens~1739~170~78~47~98~8249~0~"Chef Tory McPhail writes: ""I was 19 years old and just out of culinary school when I first started at Commander's Palace. Despite my training, nothing prepared me for the pressures of working in a fast-paced kitchen, or in a restaurant of such high quality. I think my success came down to sheer effort and a lifelong passion for cooking. Even as a kid I loved playing with cookie and pie dough."
5015435~Winter Fruit and Nut Stuffing~14346~2662~626~310~281~21030~379~Caramelized pears plus dried apricots, cranberries, and prunes add intense fruit flavor to this stuffing from Rochelle Palermo Torres, a freelance recipe developer and cooking teacher.

5015437~Lean Lasagna~3603~162~29~326~206~13069~500~Homemade, at least the way Self does it, fills you up without filling you out, but it takes an hour to make. Freeze the leftovers for quick meals that are more healthful than most of the ones you find in the freezer section of the supermarket.
5015438~Cowboy Frittata~631~29~17~25~43~1588~388~Hungry guests still rubbing the sleep from their eyes will be delighted to encounter this satisfying spin on that old diner favorite, the Western omelet. But it's just as nice for dinner, served with some roasted potatoes and a salad. This frittata is a great one to have in your recipe arsenal when you're faced with some leftover breakfast sausage (from our Sausage-Stuffed Potatoes with Green Salad, for example).
5015439~Beef and Potato Supper Pot~778~136~71~12~15~4911~0~This simple, comforting, home-style dish evolved after the Meiji Restoration, when beef entered the Japanese diet. You can easily use pork or chicken instead of the beef. Enjoy it on a snowy winter night with a side of greens.

5015457~Eggplant Steaks with Salad of Roasted Peppers, Olives, Feta and Garbanzo Beans~1643~59~21~27~150~3247~79~Thick slices of eggplant are topped with a salad of roasted red bell peppers, feta cheese, olives and garbanzo beans; then the salad is drizzled with a tangy balsamic dressing. It's nice with a Pinot Blanc or a Chardonnay. Pears poached in red wine and served with chocolate sauce and a glass of Sauternes make a lovely dessert.
5015460~Turkey Burgers with Chipotle-Chili Tartar Sauce~2156~137~34~67~165~5489~343~Chipotles give these burgers — from Hal's Bar & Grill in Venice, California — a terrific kick.
5015461~Fava Bean, Radish, and Corn Salad~2890~481~22~126~52~262~0~Any side dish or salad that includes corn is pretty, but fava beans and striking-looking breakfast radishes—with their elongated shape, rosy red color, and creamy-looking root ends—make this dish more appealing and appetizing than most. Like most chefs, I love favas, but if you can’t find them or think they are too much trouble, replace them with lima beans.
5017514~Smoky Two Chile Salsa~223~44~5~0~3~889~0~Wear gloves when working with chiles.
5015463~Butterscotch Blondie Bars With Peanut-Pretzel Caramel~11784~1309~1024~313~715~5495~1032~Adding pretzels to the caramel gives these over-the-top bars a crunchy texture and salty-sweet finish.
5015465~Pan-Fried Flounder with Potatoes in Parsley~4505~705~120~111~155~19734~315~Some dishes are best when they are as plain and simple as possible. Whole fish fried in butter and served with lemon and parsley potatoes: That is simple and tasty!

5015474~"""Pot Roast"" of Seitan, Aunt Gloria-Style"~960~193~150~5~12~2712~0~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are excerpted from Crescent Dragonwagon's book Passionate Vegetarian.

5015476~Quinoa Stir-Fry with Vegetables and Chicken~1688~244~36~75~32~5377~64~This speedy, savory meal pairs well with a workout. Quinoa is an unexpected source of energizing iron and amino acids, protein's building blocks, to nourish newly toned muscles. Body bonus: Potassium in the grain can help beat bloat.
5015477~Citrus-Cured Salmon~11~1~1~0~0~55085~0~This 24-hour method will transform uncooked salmon into a side of firm, silky fish. Buy the best you can afford.
5015478~Raspberry Zing Syrup~807~210~205~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5015479~Salt-Grilled Shrimp~1322~149~113~100~32~94577~880~Cooking on a bed of salt helps evenly conduct the high heat and infuse the shrimp with seasoning.
5015481~Salmon and Vegetable Chowder~3635~352~54~154~159~7155~657~Highly recommended!
5015482~"Beef Tenderloin Medallions with Potato ""Risotto"""~2606~363~81~57~104~14458~287~Potatoes are finely cut into small cubes, then cooked risotto-style.
5015483~Golden Slipper~270~87~0~9~0~195~4~Highly recommended!
5015485~Roast Chicken with Rosemary, Lemon, and Honey~443~98~61~0~0~93~0~Roasting the birds over rosemary sprigs imparts a surprising amount of flavor.
5015487~Cantaloupe and Prosciutto with Basil Oil~1192~11~8~67~99~3748~202~Highly recommended!
5015488~Braised Bacon, Pomegranate, and Pine Nut Relish~3599~16~4~155~326~8136~522~"We have a renewed appreciation for the beauty, taste, and health-giving properties of the pomegranate lately, and its molasses (made by cooking the juice down to a sweet-tart syrup) delivers just what we are looking for in an ingredient these days: bold, clear, complex flavor. Used in this go-with for the chops, it brings new meaning to ""sweet-and-sour pork."" Pomegranate molasses is available at some supermarkets and Middle Eastern markets and by mail from Adriana's Caravan (800-316-0820; adrianascaravan.com)."
5015489~Chilled Corn Soup with Crab and Chile Oil~588~68~57~34~16~2411~121~Active time: 20 min Start to finish: 35 min
5015490~Grilled Lamb Kebabs with Coriander and Cumin~344~33~0~0~20~484~0~Highly recommended!
5015491~Three-Cheese Mushroom and Spinach Calzone~3938~399~17~211~158~6783~608~"See ""Ingredient Tip"" for information on buying pizza dough."
5015493~Dandelion Greens with Hot Olive-Oil Dressing~1042~126~87~2~55~513~0~Instead of the usual approach of topping dandelion greens with hot bacon dressing, here we tame the greens' bitter bite with a Spanish-inspired dressing flavored with almonds, raisins, and Sherry.
5015495~Arugula, Pear and Stilton Salad~3161~143~87~102~256~2318~239~Other top-quality blue cheeses-like Maytag, Danish or Roquefort-are fine replacements for the Stilton. And if arugula is unavailable, choose another slightly bitter salad green, such as curly endive, chicory or baby salad greens; spinach mixed with some watercress would also work quite well.
5015496~Baked Irish Bacon with Kumquat Glaze~7~1~1~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5015497~Shaved Fennel and Arugula Salad~978~5~5~0~110~276~3~Highly recommended!

5015501~Blackberry-Cinnamon Cobbler~2419~396~131~35~72~4054~157~Highly recommended!
5015502~Herbed Cottage Cheese with Multigrain Bread~1567~126~15~76~84~3030~236~Highly recommended!
5018360~Mustard and Spring Onion Mash~639~42~32~14~53~616~154~Baking the potatoes first gives them a nice creamy texture. The potency of the mustard will diminish as the potatoes are being stirred over the burner; so if you really want to feel the burn, add an extra teaspoon or so of mustard just before serving.
5015504~Rhubarb-Fennel Gin Cocktail~858~175~168~0~0~10~0~If it grows together, it goes together: Sweet and sour from the rhubarb and herbaceous from the fennel, this drink is pure harmony.
5015506~Skordalia (Garlic Dip)~3676~182~20~41~316~5544~0~An indication of knowing someone really well is knowing which foods they love, like, and hate. My father loves this recipe, and I was told by Kyria Loula, who knew him as a boy, that it had to go into the book just for him. If you follow his taste buds, the more garlic the better. If you follow mine, start slow, taste as you go, and add more garlic as needed.
5015507~Vinegar Slaw~654~35~21~3~55~77~0~Highly recommended!
5015508~Vanilla Float with Bitters and Cherries~376~37~33~3~22~73~64~Highly recommended!
5015510~Curried Red-Lentil Stew with Vegetables~2065~235~17~75~91~4442~0~In India, lentil-based dals are often served as a side dish, but adding a host of vibrant vegetables turns this into a main course. Brightened with turmeric and infused with garlic, ginger, and spices, the red lentils are cooked down into a creamy purée. Best of all, the flavor improves with time, so make it ahead for a night when you need a quick supper.
5015511~Chilean Sea Bass Moho and More~1679~82~6~15~141~1019~53~If Chilean sea bass is unavailable, any sea bass is fine to use. Score the fish on the skin side, so it won't curl.
5015512~Peach-Raspberry Bundles with Orange Custard Sauce~2191~372~296~21~70~679~175~The sauce is reminiscent of that sentimental summertime favorite, the 50/50 Bar.
5015513~Apricot Custard Tart~3904~782~232~64~44~1152~161~A brandied custard filling makes a wonderful backdrop for ripe apricots.
5015514~Long-Cooked Green Beans~2879~214~143~15~223~6922~0~Highly recommended!

5015521~Fillet of Beef with Arugula, Cherry Tomatoes, and Roasted Garlic Vinaigrette~3712~157~94~43~331~873~0~Highly recommended!
5015522~Medianoche (Midnight Sandwich)~1291~35~23~89~85~4564~403~The Cubano’s cuter cousin, the Media Noche was sold as a late-night snack in Havana’s cafés. Calling for the same blend of sweet-cured ham, Swiss cheese, and pickles, it works best with juicier cuts of pork—though what really sets it apart is the egg-rich Pan de Media Noche.
5015523~Charred Tomatillo Salsa~97~20~7~1~0~656~0~Highly recommended!
5015524~Watermelon and Watercress Salad with Ginger~789~107~70~10~33~947~40~Highly recommended!

5015530~Scallop Cakes with Cilantro-Lime Mayonnaise and New Potatoes~1477~73~13~155~57~7618~285~A nice brunch dish as well as a light supper. What to drink: New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.
5015531~Rustic Nectarine and Blackberry Crostata with Cornmeal Crust~574~131~113~10~0~1836~4~Raw sugar can be found in the baking aisle.
5015532~Toasted-Almond Cake with Strawberries in Rosé-Water Syrup~5398~483~318~132~390~2667~1055~If strawberry shortcake hailed from the Middle East, it might taste like this. Toasting the almonds lets their essence permeate the cake, making it a lovely partner for strawberries that have been macerated in lemon juice and just a hint of rose water. A dollop of freshly beaten cream melds the two beautifully.
5015533~Cottage Cheese Rugelach with Walnuts~1343~140~127~25~76~228~7~Rugelach are classic cookies in the Jewish culinary repertoire. The surprise ingredient in this version--cottage cheese--makes for tender, rich cookies.
5015534~Strawberry-Cheesecake Ice Cream~2226~256~236~16~128~908~409~Highly recommended!
5015536~Sauteed Soft-Shell Crab~1108~114~38~66~62~735~212~Soaking the crabs in milk helps plump them up when cooked. Combining butter and oil results in crispy crabs.
5015537~Green Bean and Lemon Casserole~1035~9~4~0~108~812~214~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are from Feast: Food to Celebrate Life, by Nigella Lawson.
5015538~Spicy Grilled Chicken with Creamy Pumpkin Mole Sauce~1273~123~29~30~68~5333~45~Highly recommended!
5016128~Butterscotch Chiffon Pie~3091~279~121~88~227~1348~251~Remember icebox pies? And how the flavor of butterscotch always seems to melt extra slowly on your tongue? The lighter-than-air quality of the creamy filling, along with the crunch of the pecan topping, make every bite of this cooling pie a real treat.
5015540~Ginger-Curry Sugar Cookies~1977~179~171~18~116~1506~324~Plain sugar cookies, no matter how well they are made, are a bit boring to me. You may think I have gone off the rails by adding curry powder to cookies, but along with the ground and candied ginger, the combo really wakes up a classic American cookie. Give these a shot!
5015541~Chicken and Mushroom Pie with Phyllo-Parmesan Crust~4236~116~7~288~294~11111~1456~Boneless chicken thighs give a moist result, but chicken breasts work well, too. Mix wild mushrooms with cultivated button mushrooms for a deeper flavor. Goes great with: Mashed potatoes flecked with chopped fresh parsley or tarragon. What to drink: Chardonnay or Merlot.
5015542~Spinach Salad with Oranges and Warm Goat Cheese~589~24~14~19~48~1636~71~Highly recommended!
5015543~Glazed Apple Rings~490~72~67~0~23~7~63~Highly recommended!
5015544~Caramel Mousse Napoleon with Caramel Sauce and Berries~7091~746~696~104~398~485~1337~Highly recommended!
5015545~Fresh Figs with Rosemary Goat Cheese~1570~302~221~16~47~88~157~If fresh figs are difficult to find, a delicious alternative would be toasts or crackers spread with preserves-fig or peach, for example. If opting for preserves, use only half the honey called for in the goat cheese mixture.
5015546~Brown Stock~5792~1471~1260~56~22~5792~63~Highly recommended!
5015547~Red Wine and Mushroom Risotto~6717~577~17~301~349~15485~919~Highly recommended!
5015549~Spinach and Chick Peas with Bacon~1590~99~0~74~94~2900~115~This recipe—inspired by a similar dish served at the fabulously fast-paced lunch counter Cal Pep, in Barcelona, Spain—is terrific with pork chops or roast chicken.
5015550~Shrimp and Sweet Potato Cakes with Chayote Slaw and Chipotle Sauce~2489~370~67~80~69~10588~434~Chayote (often mistaken for a squash) is a fruit with a cucumber-like taste and texture. The sweet-spicy balance of this appetizer goes well with Sauvignon Blanc or beer.
5015551~Beef and Squash Chili~956~124~40~41~27~5114~31~A warming beef chili gets serious depth from toasted chiles and a touch of sweetness from squash.
5015552~Pasta with Roasted Vegetables, Tomatoes and Basil~3073~451~22~86~104~2690~118~Great served warm or at room temperature.
5015553~Spice-Rubbed Salmon~300~10~6~0~29~52~0~With uniformly sized fillets, the cooking time can be gaged precisely, resulting in the kind of lovely individual pieces of salmon served in restaurants. For four servings, buy one and a half pounds of skinned salmon fillets, taken from the thick (not the tail) end of the fish. Cut across the fillet to make four pieces of equal size.
5015554~Red Curry of Lobster and Pineapple~462~66~50~4~7~2834~0~This curry is doubly rich from the coconut milk and the deep red curry, but the pineapple keeps it from being too heavy and gives a beautiful freshness to the dish. I like to cook the lobster in the shell because it makes for a more flavorful sauce, and I like to serve it that way too. You can be as refined as you like or, like me, pick up the shell and make an animal of yourself. If lobster is going to blow the budget, you can still have a delicious curry by substituting shrimp or monkfish.
5015555~Sea Bass with Spicy Roasted Bell Pepper Sauce~1565~44~27~26~146~1736~0~Marsha also uses this versatile sauce (based on the Spanish sauce called romesco) as a pasta sauce, as a dip and on garlic toasts as an hors d'oeuvre.
5015556~Mojito Jelly~1635~331~141~30~11~86~0~We serve our remake of the Mojito—a Cuban cocktail—in lime bowls, but Martini glasses would also look sleek.
5015557~Coconut Date Nut Balls~2172~316~218~30~85~645~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5015558~Green Beans and Arugula~462~39~3~2~28~1534~0~This dish is a welcome departure from run-of-the-mill sides. Lemon zest and golden garlic give wilted arugula and tender green beans multidimensional flavor.
5015559~Apple Bread Pudding~1437~249~189~35~33~1236~447~Highly recommended!
5016244~Strawberry-Rhubarb Compote with Ginger and Lime~1716~412~364~6~0~0~0~This recipe is an accompaniment for Vanilla-Citrus Tea Ring . Any remaining compote would be great for breakfast or dessert with a spoonful of yogurt or crème fraîche.
5015561~Pistachio Popover Cremes Brulees with Grand Marnier Syrup~5418~752~604~101~284~1291~1094~Active time: 1 1/4 hr Start to finish: 6 1/4 hr (includes chilling)
5015562~Lemon and Amaretti Semifreddo with Raspberry Sauce~3461~414~413~20~224~410~794~"Although the name means ""half-frozen,"" a semifreddo is made by freezing a mousse-like custard in a mold. The result is an airy confection, which may explain the impression that it is only semifreddo."
5015563~Red Radishes Stuffed with Blue Cheese~1187~18~7~27~110~1701~315~Highly recommended!
5015564~Mashed Potatoes with Crisp Ham~3857~697~147~110~61~22312~158~Highly recommended!
5015566~Super-Simple Pumpkin Tiramisu~2281~246~231~5~135~156~512~This needs to set up overnight, so start one day ahead.
5015567~Broiled Steak with Horseradish Cream~197~7~3~3~17~1877~0~Highly recommended!
5015568~Meyer Lemon and Vanilla Bean Marmalade~4879~1301~1301~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5015569~Pork Chops and Squash with Pumpkin Seed Vinaigrette~1552~143~54~41~86~193~69~There's no need to peel acorn, kabocha, or delicata squash; their skins are tender and edible, and add extra color and texture to the dish.
5015570~Honey-Orange Madeleines~2527~245~71~35~149~146~749~Keep these cookies in airtight containers.
5015571~Salty Dog~298~99~11~0~2~133~2~Highly recommended!
5015572~Double Chocolate Torte~7470~697~566~60~493~1671~1901~Highly recommended!

5015580~Garlic-Miso Pork Chops with Orange Bell Pepper and Arugula~639~49~9~13~41~132~0~Highly recommended!
5015582~Spiced Zucchini Bread~5217~787~475~145~253~4041~578~Though we call this a bread, it’s really more of a spice cake that uses grated fresh zucchini as a surprise ingredient. Serve it warm for breakfast, with cream cheese or butter and honey.
5015583~Scandinavian Sugar-Browned Potatoes~673~103~43~7~24~3381~63~These are eaten throughout Scandinavia, but they are especially popular in Denmark. The Swedish version would have more sugar; the Swedes like sweeter food than the other Scandinavians.
5015584~Roasted Zucchini Lasagna~2459~139~28~117~169~4360~139~Use zucchini ribbons in place of pasta for this noodle-less vegetarian layered dish.
5015585~Asparagus Napoleons with Oriental Black Bean Sauce~1364~164~43~29~78~2102~0~Highly recommended!
5015586~Cinnamon-Oat Crumble Topping~2252~337~124~65~103~750~253~This crunchy crumble is the perfect topping for an ice cream sundae, easy apple crumble, or our Build-Your-Own Thanksgiving Pie Bar. Pro tip: Keep a batch of the unbaked mixture in the freezer in case of dessert emergencies.
5015587~Queen Elizabeth's Favorite Quiche~3021~193~47~158~216~6606~1078~Highly recommended!
5015591~Green Beans and Roasted Squash with Sherry Soy Butter~1155~15~3~3~119~1678~214~Active time: 50 min Start to finish: 1 1/2 hr
5015592~Roasted Mushroom and Barley Gravy~1062~108~44~12~58~4331~0~This vegetarian gravy is layered with bold flavors — from the onions to the roasted mushrooms and barley — each of which makes a real statement. Even our carnivorous food editors agree it's one of the best gravies they've ever tasted.
5015593~Asian Pear and Ginger Vinaigrette~1221~35~27~1~110~1276~0~This dressing is a little sweet from the miso and pear, and aromatic from the ginger and lime; pair it with something peppery, like radishes for dipping or a watercress salad.
5015594~Peas and Pea Tendrils with Lemon Dressing~632~27~19~8~55~587~0~Highly recommended!
5015595~Orange Fools~584~57~52~9~34~196~98~Highly recommended!
5015596~Fresh Corn Madeleines with Sour Cream and Caviar~436~30~9~26~22~2081~351~Highly recommended!
5015598~Orange-Rosemary Chicken~1429~163~8~14~75~3849~0~It's almost as quick to make the citrus-herb glaze that coats the chicken as it is to open a bottle of barbecue sauce-and the glaze has a far more interesting taste. Pour a Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc for the grown-ups; the kids should have lemonade. Finish up with watermelon and brownies.
5015599~Sage Butter-Roasted Turkey with Cider Gravy~629~29~2~12~47~19468~160~Two quintessential autumn ingredients—sage and cider—flavor this turkey-gravy combo.
5015600~Green Herb Risotto~2734~384~11~70~89~4700~122~To turn this starter into a main course, top it with skewers of grilled shrimp.
5015601~Frozen Praline Souffles~1151~179~178~9~50~378~164~Highly recommended!
5015602~Chile-Pepper Water~176~33~0~0~0~0~0~Fragrant, fiery chile-pepper water is an essential condiment on the Hawaiian table, where a few drops of the stuff transforms even stodgy cutlets and lumpen beef stews into something almost magical.
5015603~Marbleized Root Vegetable Purée~5225~858~233~81~147~21512~410~Root vegetables became a mainstay of the New England diet. The crops grew well during the summer and could be stored in barrels of sand or in root cellars to keep through the long winter. This spectacular casserole has potatoes, parsnips, turnips and carrots, and is sweetened with just a hint of pear. The pureed vegetables are swirled together in the baking dish to create a pretty marbled effect.
5015604~Yam Neua~919~142~70~36~19~5259~58~(Grilled Beef Salad)
5015606~Fried Rice~786~44~14~28~57~4193~380~Feel free to use leftover rice from last night's takeout. The secret to good fried rice is starting with cold cooked grains.

5015610~Lebanese Garlic-Marinated Chicken on the Grill~2698~55~13~178~197~6638~444~This is another good recipe for skinless, boneless chicken breasts since the olive oil compensates for the dryness of the meat, but if you prefer, by all means, leave the skin on. For the finest flavor and texture, use chicken breasts from naturally raised free-range birds. For extra garlic flavor, serve it with Lebanese toum bi zeit (garlic sauce) . Precede it with a chilled gazpacho and serve the chicken with fresh pita bread or slices of a crusty country loaf and a massive green salad for a memorable summer Sunday lunch.
5015612~Pineapple Split~1611~265~206~23~55~240~0~The classic dessert goes tropical in this luscious rendition featuring pineapple and coconut.
5015613~Vanilla Ice Cream with Sesame Candies and Halvah~1909~163~145~27~127~503~454~Highly recommended!
5015614~Vanilla-Buttermilk Wedding Cake With Raspberries and Orange Cream-Cheese Frosting~24470~3279~2243~257~920~5251~2774~Baking a wedding cake is not as crazy—or difficult—as it sounds! This stunning and delicious cake is designed to be as streamlined as possible. The moist buttermilk cake requires no trimming, the cream cheese frosting is much more simple (and just as stable) as wedding cake's typical buttercream, and edible flowers and pretty raspberries make decorating a breeze.
5015615~Grilled Pork Chops with Garlic Lime Sauce~292~33~0~21~3~58~69~Pouring a citrusy vinaigrette over hot grilled pork chops enhances their flavor and balances their richness. The chops go extremely well with the black-bean and tomato quinoa
5015616~Tomato-Coriander Bruschetta~996~103~1~10~55~576~0~"Steve Silverman of South Burlington, Vermont, writes: ""In my cooking I tend to be very quick and health-conscious. During the summer, my wife, Mary, and I usually grill chicken or fish and make salads. I'll use whatever fresh vegetables and ingredients I have on hand and come up with a wonderful meal for the two of us."""

5015622~Baked Apples with Candied Fennel and Pistachios~1086~228~222~1~23~12~63~In our Egg Salad with Lemon and Fennel , fennel contributes juicy crunch and a nice hit of bright flavor. Here, the leftover fennel goes in a decidedly different direction: Candied in a sugar syrup, it has a softer snap and becomes more mellow. Along with pistachios, golden raisins, and fennel seeds, it makes a sophisticated filling for baked Gala apples. Many baked–apple recipes are too homey for company, but this version, with its spectrum of greens and golds, would be the highlight of any dinner party menu.
5015623~Finnan Haddie Chowder~2502~248~102~73~130~7470~318~Chowders are by far my favorite kinds of soup and often feature at our table on a Saturday lunchtime. The best, I think is clam, followed closely by finnan haddie. If you can, try and buy some really good-quality undyed finnan haddie, which has a more subtle flavor than some of the others.
5015624~Pistachio, Raspberry, and White Chocolate Biscotti~5572~1032~462~98~106~2546~393~For variety, dip half of the biscotti in melted white chocolate and the other half in dark chocolate. Or, drizzle the melted chocolate over the biscotti instead.
5015626~Double Olive Pasta~4071~282~49~142~134~6075~259~The title refers to the black and green olives featured in this piquant dish.

The recipe comes from Antonio's restaurant, in New Bedford, Massachusetts, where they accompany the stew with fried potatoes.
5015636~Grilled Pork Chops with Molasses Barbecue Sauce~1377~280~241~0~33~6766~3~Magnolia Grill offers these chops with a black-eyed pea risotto and homemade corn relish. The pork is chilled overnight in brine.

5015648~Vanilla Creams with Strawberries in Cassis~855~155~134~28~14~443~50~Flavored creams (rose cream, geranium cream) served with berries are common in Britain. This take on the classic is a mix of drained yogurt and fromage blanc (fresh cream cheese). The soft, not too-sweet creams taste like a cross between an American-style pudding and a panna cotta. Keep in mind that the desserts need to chill at least eight hours.
5015649~Aloo Gobhi Stuffing~3237~203~48~78~242~5485~214~Chunks of tender cauliflower and potato tossed with Indian spices give this stuffing a lovely, distinctive texture and flavor.

5015651~Rugelach Three Ways~1947~358~310~4~50~340~177~I am a big fan of rugelach made with cream cheese, so I used soy cream cheese to make these. There are so many different fillings for rugelach; my favorite is apricot jam or chocolate. It is fun to make different flavors so that when you place them on a platter, you see rows of different color swirls. In my baking classes, I give the students a buffet of choices so they can create their own combinations. Here I've given you three fillings to choose from. If you prefer to make one type, simply double one of the filling recipes (each filling amount is enough for half the dough). Or you can divide the dough into four and make four typesany flavor of jam, coconut, raisins, currants, or any kind of chopped nuts make great fillings.
5015652~Jalapeño Honey Mustard Pork Kebabs~895~23~16~26~72~25186~92~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5015656~Crab Fritters with Spicy Lime Sauce~1317~126~69~60~60~10689~302~Here's an Asian - and very elegant - spin on the classic American crab cakes. A dry Gewürztraminer compliments the flavors of this appetizer very well.
5015657~Three-Cheese and Mushroom Orecchiette~4235~382~22~182~216~5271~589~Cheese power: Monterey Jack and parmesan are creamy and smooth, while blue lends a subtle savoriness.

5015660~Sautéed Kale with Garlic, Shallots, and Capers~728~49~7~0~55~249~0~The slight bitterness of the greens cuts through the richness of the meat and potatoes in this menu. Feel free to use any variety of kale (or a mix of varieties) in this dish. Green, red, or Tuscan kale (sometimes called lacinato or dinosaur kale) would all be delicious. 3 pounds kale (about 4 large bunches), thick bottom stems and center stems cut away and discarded

5015664~"Roast Beef for ""Beef on Weck"""~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~If you aren't a restaurant chef or caterer, you probably don’t want to cook a 40-pound round roast, which is what most Buffalo chefs use. But a nice eye of round, 4 to 6 pounds, works fine.
5015665~Vanilla Chiffon Cake with Chocolate Sorbet~2575~501~400~12~44~1111~370~Fruit — such as kiwi, orange, pineapple and berries — is a nice garnish for this cake. If you like, puree some of the berries with sugar to make a colorful sauce.

5015670~Honey-Brined Turkey with Giblet Cream Gravy~2421~317~204~35~115~194127~316~"Janet Fletcher, food writer, says,""My grandmother could never seem to make enough of her creamy giblet gravy; everyone always wanted more. We poured it over the mashed potatoes, dressing and turkey, then over open-face sandwiches the next day. Of course, it's great with this turkey, too: The bird gets its incredible moistness from being soaked overnight in a brine enhanced by thyme, garlic cloves and honey.""Because of the brining process, we don’t recommend stuffing this turkey."
5015672~Cranberry and Blood Orange Relish~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~Just three ingredients make a fresh and bright uncooked relish—and the colors are beautiful, too.

5015678~Cider, Bacon, and Golden Raisin Stuffing~9427~1541~1240~156~300~14006~1018~A blend of whole grain and country breads gives this stuffing just the right deep, earthy flavor, while cider and vinegar-spiked golden raisins lend a few high notes. And the bacon? That's what makes it irresistible.
5015679~Baked Mashed Potatoes and Yams with Garlic and Parmesan~3957~621~125~94~112~16973~165~Yams are blended with regular russets in a nice rendition of mashed potatoes. If you decide to double the recipe, use a 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish.

""Like a traditional Pimm's Cup, this recipe works well with other spirits, including bourbon, rum, and tequila,"" he says. ""You have my permission to experiment."" St-Germain liqueur, made from Alpine elderflowers, brings a floral note."
5015692~Israeli Couscous with Roasted Eggplant and Cinnamon-Cumin Dressing~1549~199~16~23~72~1892~0~Try this deliciously smoky side dish with grilled lamb chops.
5015693~Collard Greens and Kale Pesto~3011~69~5~46~293~1220~34~You wouldn't blanch tender herbs such as basil, but doing so here softens the collards and kale.
5015694~Maple Custard Cups~1194~116~112~32~68~1213~573~Maple syrup and maple sugar infuse a simple vanilla custard with a rich caramelized flavor.
5015695~Pan-Seared Steak with Mushroom-Merlot Sauce~917~24~7~36~89~1893~195~This elegant entrée deserves special accompaniments, like buttered baby carrots sprinkled with chopped tarragon, twice-baked potatoes (available frozen) and a spinach salad tossed with toasted walnuts. New-York-style cheesecake with strawberries provides the properly indulgent finale.
5015696~Peanut Butter Tart with Caramel-Peanut Glaze~5375~470~206~98~339~1083~652~"Christine Warren of New York, New York, writes: ""On a recent evening out on the town, my friends and I decided to go for Margaritas at Zarela.

5015698~Peach and Mixed-Berry Crisp~1524~262~260~0~58~491~158~The mixture of fruit in this dessert, a long-standing menu item at The Marx Bros. Cafe in Anchorage, might include anything from wild Alaskan blueberries to apples, depending on the time of year.
5015699~Gumbo Z'herbes~904~106~42~29~36~4230~106~If you can't find one type of the greens for this recipe, you can either increase the other two kinds proportionally or substitute kale and/or chard.
5015700~Fettuccine with Trapanese Pesto~3208~421~44~111~108~4248~24~This pesto, from Trapani, in Sicily, is made with almonds and tomato and far less basil than traditional pesto — don't expect it to be green.
5015705~Hot-and-Sour Soup with Shrimp, Napa Cabbage, and Shiitake Mushrooms~606~19~0~105~9~3254~880~With authentic Asian flavor, this soup is a perfect light supper.
5017536~Pistachio Sea Bass with Crab Salad~1904~184~8~103~63~4164~317~Cooking the sea bass in parchment paper is a great technique — it keeps the pistachio topping in place and allows you to brown both the fish and the topping in the skillet (the parchment becomes translucent so you can see the browning. Since Gras is on the West Coast, he likes to use Dungeness crab when he makes this dish. We've substituted jumbo lump crabmeat because it's available year round nationwide.
5015708~Mint and Cumin–Spiced Lamb Chops~1233~251~169~22~16~1030~81~If your dad is anything like ours, he’s going to love these spiced-up grilled lamb chops.

5015710~Chinese Egg Noodles with Smoked Duck and Snow Peas~532~39~12~15~35~2525~0~If you live near a Chinese market, pick up barbecued or smoked duck there. Otherwise, smoked chicken or turkey from the supermarket (or leftover roast chicken) would be terrific tossed with the noodles. To make it a meal, add a platter of chilled silken tofu. Drizzle the tofu with soy sauce and chili sauce, then top with chopped green onions. Coconut ice cream with fresh berries and lychees would make a nice dessert.
5015711~Lemon-Pistachio Crunch Cake~12462~1487~805~146~637~5445~1891~Lemon curd separates the layers of this fine-crumbed, very-special-occasion cake. Get started at least one day ahead: The frosting base and lemon curd must chill overnight before using. For the frosting, high-quality white chocolate (such as Lindt or Perugina) works best.
5015712~Arugula and Goat Cheese Mashed Potatoes~5894~1054~242~139~110~31756~260~Terrific with roast chicken, lamb or steak.

5015716~Light-and-Crisp Whole-Wheat Bread Crumbs~243~45~8~2~8~405~0~"Homemade bread crumbs are one of those ""chefs secrets""—an important but often overlooked detail that can make a dish. These easy-to-make crumbs are flaky, mild, and versatile—they dont have that heavy whole-wheat taste and dense texture that most store-bought brands have. Since bread crumbs are a comfort-food cornerstone used in everything from cutlet coatings to casserole toppings, its key to have the best."
5015717~Mango Fools with Chocolate-Anise Straws~687~17~15~6~70~66~235~Canned mangoes are excellent in this dessert if ripe fresh ones are unavailable. Use a drained (1-lb 14-oz) can of mango slices in syrup. If the canned fruits you buy are Alphonso mangoes (our favorite variety of mango), add an additional 1/2 cup cream.

5015749~Cranberry, Fig, and Pinot Noir Chutney~5847~1147~951~95~76~5967~315~Cranberries are transformed with sweet, subtly earthy dried figs and velvety, slightly spicy Pinot Noir into a chunky, jamlike chutney. Orange zest infuses the mix with its bright citrus flavor and essential oils. Ginger works well in both savory and sweet preparations, and its touch of heat bridges the wine and fruit here. You can serve this chutney instead of the standard cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving, but it is also wonderful with pork and venison dishes, spread on a sandwich, or as an accompaniment to a cheese plate.
5015750~Crown Roast of Lamb with Rosemary and Oregano~167~33~0~0~0~5816~0~Crown roasts are often done with pork, but lamb also makes for a festive presentation—and it's a delicious change of pace. Request the roasts from the butcher ahead of time, since they are usually prepared to order. Pour a Syrah with dinner if you've chosen this main course.

5018401~Ginger, Fig, and Cranberry Semifreddo with Blackberry Sauce~2467~22~21~10~216~967~869~"This is like a frozen mousse, which helps explain its name: semifreddo, or ""half-frozen."" Start preparation a day ahead."
5015753~Banana Waffles with Pecan Maple Syrup~1169~151~144~16~60~2296~433~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5015754~Tomato Black-Pepper Granita~408~96~88~7~0~145~0~Not overly sweet, and with a spunky kick, this palate cleanser is a take on the traditional Italian combination of strawberries, black pepper, and balsamic vinegar. (It also tastes great in a Bloody Mary.)

5015763~Peanut Butter Cupcakes~2864~326~185~99~174~1610~254~Highly recommended!
5015764~Indian Pudding with Nutmeg Ice Cream~2125~197~144~106~94~4037~687~"The name Indian pudding comes from the addition of cornmeal here — early colonists called most everything made with corn ""Indian."" Originally the pudding was cooked in a pot over the open hearth and was very dense. This is a lighter version baked in a modern oven, but we kept the traditional step of pouring milk or cream over the top of the pudding before cooking it."
5015765~Beer-Marinated Pork Tenderloin with Red Cabbage~1194~86~71~25~84~4731~117~You need only a small amount of beer to flavor the sauce. We trust you know what to do with the rest of that bottle.
5015766~Spice-Rubbed Sustainable Fish Sliders~1595~275~163~43~46~4264~56~Sliders are simple, but perfecting them is a bit of an art. It’s all about getting the three main components—the sauce, the filling and the bread—in the right ratio. We’ve got the sauce and filling covered, so all you need to do is get some fresh bread.

5015768~French Lentil, Prosciutto, and Pepper Salad~789~108~62~31~11~44009~83~I adore lentils, particularly the green French variety, as well as the little black ones, sometimes known as beluga lentils because of their resemblance to caviar. Both of these types hold their shape better than the typical brown lentil, and their nutty texture and flavor are divine. This is my favorite fall salad, made a bit indulgent with the addition of prosciutto. I first made this for an autumnal baby shower, and it was a major hit. The earthiness of the lentils and prosciutto plays wonderfully off the color and sweetness of autumn's bounty of peppers. This salad works equally well with meat, chicken, or fish. Best of all, it can be served at room temperature, and tastes even better the next day. So, make the salad the day before, heat up the grill, pop a few corks, and enjoy the sunshine!
5015769~Grilled Asian Pork Chops and Baby Bok Choy~744~96~54~23~25~1508~69~Serve with: Gingered rice pilaf and summer lettuces with a sesame vinaigrette.

5015774~Spinach Salad with Grilled Red Onion and Tahini Vinaigrette~2067~156~10~80~123~2530~0~Tahini, a creamy sesame seed paste, adds a new twist to the dressing for the salad.

5015777~Crab Legs with Mustard Dipping Sauce~2301~19~3~160~173~9218~843~This appetizer has been one of the restaurant's most popular since it opened in 1950. For a pretty presentation, arrange the crab legs in Belgian endive spears, and garnish with cucumber and radicchio.
5015778~Rich Sweet Pastry Dough~1344~197~0~96~78~1164~218~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time. Can be used for Blood Orange Crostata

5015780~Cauliflower Soup with Almonds~791~96~43~29~28~5372~45~This soup looks thick but doesn't taste at all heavy. In fact, it has an almost billowy texture, but with enough substance to still be satisfying. The addition of just a small amount of toasted almonds adds some crunch to the equation.
5015782~Lamb and Orzo Stuffed Pepper with Chunky Tomato Sauce~632~83~39~29~21~2507~91~If you have to buy more than the amount of ground lamb needed for this recipe, use the leftover meat to make a juicy lamb burger a day or two later.
5015783~Oven-Poached Salmon Steaks with Mustard Dill Sauce~850~78~67~0~35~6843~0~Highly recommended!
5015784~Fastest Chicken Parm~2419~187~14~127~136~3123~225~This take on the classic couldn’t be easier: Instead of dredging and panfrying, just stack the ingredients in two stages on a baking sheet and broil. Done this way, the tomatoes get lightly roasted and the bread crumbs stay nice and crunchy.
5015785~Macaroni and Blue Cheese with Chives~5705~112~52~273~445~10041~1507~"Marie G. Beltran of Seattle, Washington, writes: ""The signature dish at Blue Onion Bistro here in Seattle is a rich, velvety macaroni made with blue cheese. The restaurant, which is housed in a former corner gas station, is both nostalgic and comforting, just like the delicious dish. Is there any way you could persuade chef Scott Simpson to divulge the recipe?"""
5015786~Tropical Fruit Crepes with Vanilla Bean and Rum Butter Sauce~3499~493~325~27~152~1832~744~This dessert needs some last-minute assembly, so appoint a helper or line up the components to make it all go smoothly.

5015794~Potato & Celery Root Gratin with Leeks~7945~417~59~186~620~4414~1427~Celery root, also known as celeriac, has a knobby exterior that is best peeled (carefully!) with a paring knife.

5015796~Mahimahi with Citrus Sauce, Apple Bananas, and Macadamia Nuts~2610~243~186~28~168~2575~92~Mahimahi is on of Hawaii's most popular fish; firm-fleshed and mild-flavored, it can be cooked in almost any manner and cloaked in almost any sauce. I like the flavor of citrus with mahimahi, enhanced by some spicy peppercorns. Sweet bananas, a hint of coconut, and macadamia nuts add to the tropical flavors in this light dish.
5015797~Tagliatelle with Asparagus and Parmesan Fonduta~2255~62~17~87~181~2422~651~This entire dish is right out of Rose and Ruthie's River Café playbook, with just a few tweaks of my own. They taught me how to make fonduta, a silky sauce rich with crème fraîche and egg yolks. It takes less time and just a bit more effort than tomato sauce, and turns a plate of pasta into an elegant and impressive meal. Get yourself some asparagus spears that are as thick as your pointer finger—not those thin or sprouty ones—and you'll enjoy the juicy slivers in each bite.
5015798~Phyllo-Wrapped Figs with Prosciutto and Stilton~4254~160~100~61~369~2595~1023~"Gail W. Dorsey of Lynnfield, Massachusetts, writes: ""Fresh figs were featured in an unusual appetizer at The Gatehouse Restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island.

5015801~Boiled Coffee~369~73~36~18~0~2218~0~Boiling this strong coffee with eggshells clarifies it by helping the grounds to settle.
5015802~Orange Poppy Seed Pancakes with Rosemary Maple Syrup~2082~459~259~118~38~3294~464~These fluffy pancakes get an extra dose of nutrition (not to mention serious crunch) from a combination of poppy and sunflower seeds. Use any citrus you like for the batter, but we're especially fond of how oranges pair with the rosemary-infused maple syrup. All-purpose flour may be substituted for spelt, however we love the unique nuttiness that spelt brings to this recipe.

5015808~Anchovy Lemon Dip with Green Beans~1206~186~42~48~20~3059~47~This dip has all the umami seductiveness of a bagna cauda. In August's heat, however, you'll be thrilled that it's a cool version and not too heavy—just thick enough to cling to green beans.

Creative cooks even blend it into pâté to spread on toast. Drying meat and fish was a necessary method of preservation prior to refrigeration.
5019600~Chicken Vindaloo~1678~56~13~135~89~1119~606~Highly recommended!
5015827~Ginger Cardamom Oeufs à la Neige~906~72~54~38~52~613~426~"Inspired by a dessert served at Le Bistro Paul Bert, in Paris, we used Indian spices to restyle this elegant classic custard. It takes its French name (""eggs in the snow"") from the lightly poached dollops of meringue that top it."
5015828~Barbecued Chicken with Vinegar Basting Sauce~790~157~140~18~0~6093~45~This light and spicy sauce is especially good on chicken. For convenience, you can mix the spices ahead, then add the vinegar just before using.

5015833~Roasted Leg of Lamb with North African Spices, Lemon, and Onions~510~8~6~0~55~17451~0~I call this herb and spice rub North African because, besides the classic oregano and rosemary, it contains Tunisian and Moroccan spices such as caraway, cumin, and turmeric. In addition, it is spiked with harissa, the ubiquitous hot pepper paste that is to Arab North Africa what chile oil is to Asia. Use the same spice mixture to rub poultry, beef, or pork two to three hours before grilling and leave at room temperature. Or you can mix 3 tablespoons of this rub with 3 tablespoons yogurt and baste chicken breasts or legs or skewered lamb and pork before grilling. Better yet, leave in the spicy yogurt marinade in the refrigerator overnight.
5015834~Pork Loin Spiedino with Pine Nut, Garlic, and Currant Soffritto~2744~129~85~191~180~11760~526~"A spiedo is a kitchen spit over an open fire that is most often used for cooking whole animals, particularly chicken. Spiedino—;literally ""little spit""—refers to food cooked on skewers, which is how we like to prepare pork loin. Grilled briefly over a smoky fire, the meat takes on an addictive char that counterbalances the sweet, mellow soffritto of pine nuts, garlic, and currants."

5015843~Rigatoni With Lemon-Chile Pesto and Grated Egg~994~7~6~12~97~475~269~The butter (yep, a whole stick) mellows the tart lemon sauce and is key to the finished texture.

5015856~Cold-Brew Coffee~1747~208~174~26~87~504~33~If you're using a commercial cold-brew maker like a Toddy, follow the manufacturer's instructions for mixing and filtering. Feel free to play around with how you dilute this—you might prefer a stronger or weaker coffee than the one suggested here. And coffee-heads the world over agree: cold-brew is only as good as the beans it's made with.
5015857~Lobster Fra Diavolo~2927~436~117~63~76~2303~7~While reminiscent of a marinara sauce, red bell pepper, cognac, and jalapeño add hints of newness to this luscious, traditional favorite lobster dish.

Here's a salad that puts a twist on classic holiday flavors. Homemade smoked marzipan mingles with crisp prosciutto and caramelized figs on arugula dotted with a ricotta cream. If your ricotta is on the wet side, see our instructions for how to drain it, an important step before making the cream. The marzipan can be made up to five days in advance.

5015863~Charred Sugar Snap Peas with Buttermilk Aioli~2090~123~37~28~157~1431~46~The aioli will appear quite tight when all the oil is incorporated, but it will loosen to a pourable consistency once the buttermilk and shallot are added.
5015864~Gochujang Pork Shoulder Steaks~3549~151~102~197~209~12795~728~Keep an eye on the edge of the meat where it touches the grill: When it's browned, turn the pork over.

Traditionally, a brown Betty is made with apples, breadcrumbs, and spices. In this updated version, pears stand in for the apples and the breadcrumbs are enriched with almonds. Keep in mind that this dessert is best eaten the day it's made (but any leftovers would be nice for breakfast)."

5015876~Shrimp Boil~1209~49~9~147~43~14068~1321~How do you impart the most flavor in a boil without overcooking the shrimp? Ice!

For a classic meal, pair with corn on the cob and boiled potatoes, or serve as a starter for a crowd.

5015900~Grilled Stuffed Peppers~2766~294~38~108~121~14771~351~Stuffed peppers come out well on the grill if you don't make them too big. I like to mix ground meats and season the stuffed peppers heavily. Be sure to cook a little of the meat mixture to test the seasonings before you stuff the peppers, since the salt and spice levels of the various sausage meats and seasoning mixes vary widely.

5015906~Clotted Cream~3939~0~0~0~473~390~1573~Clotted cream is not a part of my own traditional food culture but it is a forgotten skill in everyday cooking and is so gorgeous and so easy to make that it is really worth doing every now and then.
5015907~Roasted Sardines With Carrot-Fennel Slaw~446~70~25~13~5~3604~27~Fresh sardines are nothing like their tinned cousins; their flavor is rich and far more delicate. Dressed with a miso glaze and augmented by rainbow carrots and fresh fennel, this is a wonderful, light meal.
5015908~Duck Breast with Sweet Cherry Sauce~1307~123~52~49~63~5108~182~Highly recommended!
5015909~Easy Cranberry & Apple Cake~3179~554~381~56~107~768~612~"This recipe is inspired by a cranberry pie from Sarah Chase's book Cold Weather Cooking.

5015910~Chocolate-Cranberry Torte~8671~1174~1001~52~436~2341~1313~What to drink: Offer robust French roast coffee, but also a vintage or ruby Port.

5015926~Apple Fritters with Bourbon Ice Cream~4098~827~504~53~62~1431~512~Another delicious thing about this addictive dessert? The fritters can be fried up to two hours ahead, then rewarmed just before serving.
5015929~Five Bean Picnic Salad~822~127~18~38~12~2150~10~Gina: This colorful salad is one of my go-to recipes when I need something to satisfy a crowd, whether at a church potluck supper or a backyard barbecue. The champagne vinaigrette gives the beans a fresh, zippy flavor. For the best results, add the fresh beans to the salad just before serving, so they do not discolor.

The final flourish, rimming the glasses with sea salt and black pepper, adds a slight tingle to each sip.

5015947~Homemade Buttermilk~494~62~57~19~16~1095~63~"Buttermilk is the tangy heart and soul of so many of our favorite Southern foods. Sadly, the supermarket stuff is ""eh"" at best. So we make our own."

5015957~Epicurean Broiled Turkey~81~6~1~9~1~521~34~Turkeys weighing 4 to 7 pounds will be excellent broiled — grilled. They must be split and cooked over low heat — far from the coals — for the first 40 minutes. Then they may be moved closer to the heat to finish cooking and browning.
5015958~Scottish Trifle~5205~710~595~113~238~3689~758~Highly recommended!

5015964~Grilled Beef, Chicken, Shrimp, and Mushroom Skewers~608~43~5~59~13~5161~315~To make your cocktail party more participatory, have your guests grill their own skewers. A hibachi is even more user-friendly than a grill, since the ends of the skewers hang out over the edge, eliminating the need for tongs. If you're cooking everything yourself, it's easiest to use a large grill or a broiler (see cooks' note, below) and serve the skewers in batches.
5015965~Perfect Grass-Fed Beef Burgers~936~121~55~40~33~5570~47~Adding onion delivers moisture; forming thicker patties prevents them from cooking too fast and drying out. Both steps are key when working with grass-fed ground beef.

5015972~Mojito Marinade~1975~244~195~7~114~8885~0~For years I carted cases of this citrus-flavored Cuban marinade back from Miami, til we started making it in the restaurant. The real thing is all tarted up with the juice of bitter oranges — nearly impossible to find. So we add a touch of lime juice to freshly squeezed orange juice to give it the right kick. It's one of the most versatile pantry ingredients you can make. Use it as a marinade for pork and chicken, pour it over cooked veggies or potatoes, or toss it with salad greens.
5015973~Mashed Potato Skordalia~1381~211~38~17~46~5296~0~Traditional Greek skordalia is mostly garlic and olive oil with some potato or nuts added to thicken it. We flipped the ratio in this recipe: more potato, less garlic. Serve as a dip, or thin out with lemon juice and olive oil and use as a sauce for fish.

5015987~Cornbread Muffins with Maple Butter~4823~461~137~74~216~2354~541~These are just a tiny bit sweet. For the tenderest result, stir in dry ingredients just until blended.

5016002~Bittersweet Chocolate-Orange Fondue~21083~3173~2452~164~869~14009~2622~Grand Marnier and grated orange peel add a touch of elegance to this simple indulgence. Prepare the fondue just before serving, and keep it warm while dipping so that it will remain smooth. Use a traditional fondue pot, or place the pan of the fondue on an electric hot plate. Either way, be sure the heat is low; too much heat will cause the chocolate to burn. Angel food cake, pound cake and a variety of fresh and dried fruits make great accompaniments.

5016011~Capellini with Fresh Ricotta, Roasted Garlic, Corn, and Herbs~2812~279~38~109~148~4129~231~Fresh ricotta cheese (available at some supermarkets and at Italian markets) and good-quality olive oil are the keys to this great salty-sweet dish.
5016012~White-Cut Chicken~899~39~13~30~53~5946~56~It's traditional to serve a whole chicken, including the head and feet, for Chinese New Year. The white meat symbolizes purity, and serving the entire bird represents unity. Plunging the chicken into ice water after poaching ensures that the meat is perfectly juicy and tender. A very simple but powerful dipping sauce tops it off. Use only a tiny amount — it's quite strong.

5016021~Japanese Noodles with Bok Choy and Tofu~661~86~35~10~29~3189~0~Dried udon noodles are found in the Asian foods section of most supermarkets; if unavailable, use linguine instead.

5016031~Mexican Chopped Salad with Honey-Lime Dressing~2395~400~129~75~83~1871~41~Tortillas aren't the only depository for beans, corn and tomatoes. Let romaine lettuce do the job. Feta cheese supplies a dose of calcium and major flavor. And the honey-lime dressing adds just the right touch of tangy sweetness. Buen provecho!
5016032~French Onion Bites~2141~44~8~114~152~2807~398~Think of these as the best part of French onion soup minus the broth. Better yet, they're in a form that's much easier to eat than the soggy wet bread, weighed down with cheese, that usually tops crocks of onion soup. Don't be surprised if these disappear before you get a chance to sample one yourself!
5016033~Coconut-Macaroon and Lemon Ice Cream Sandwiches~2858~308~305~18~190~590~637~This chilly treat may well make your freezer more popular than the neighborhood ice cream truck. The lemony ice cream center is a bright contrast to the surrounding chewy coconut macaroons — and the sandwiches are easily held by eager little hands.

5016036~Hot Oat & Quinoa Cereal~805~169~59~15~7~3051~0~If you think quinoa is only good for savory salads and pilafs, you're missing out. Pair it with steel-cut oats to amplify its hearty flavor. A little maple syrup brings out its sweet side.

5016041~Swordfish Niçoise~965~102~10~49~16~8028~44~Don't marinate the fish more than 15 minutes, or it will be cooked by the citric acid in the lemon juice (like the Latin dish seviche). And don't toss the vegetables until serving time, or the vinegar will discolor the beans.
5016042~Parmesan Custard Tart with Butternut Squash~2848~165~8~102~236~1507~589~Highly recommended!

5016046~Cucumber and Avocado Soup with Tomato and Basil Salad~2397~60~89~75~38~650~2~Highly recommended!
5016048~Strawberry and Peach Parfaits with Maple Granola~1999~308~49~62~59~180~15~These are also nice for breakfast. Just top them with nonfat vanilla yogurt instead of the frozen yogurt suggested in the recipe.
5016049~Grilled Saffron Rack of Lamb~542~53~14~8~28~195~9~The lamb needs to marinate overnight, so be sure to start 1 day ahead.
5016050~Chicken and Cheese Sliders~1290~182~65~55~32~46379~84~How they fight fat Chicken and cheddar both pitch in. The protein in poultry helps burn fat, and cheese has two slenderizing perks: Calcium breaks down fat, as linoleic acids stoke metabolism.
5016051~Leek and Asparagus Frittata~1803~50~10~105~126~4001~830~Highly recommended!
5016052~Habanero Jam~381~97~91~0~0~4887~0~Looks like a perfectly innocent bowl of apricot jam, burns like a bright and fruity pepper jelly.
5016053~Lemongrass-Ginger-Carrot Soup~892~100~62~42~40~4293~18~This simple soup can be eaten hot or cold, in winter, or in summer. Many are aware of the healing benefits of carrots, mainly the antioxidant-rich carotenoids that are known to pack anticancer powers. We love them because they're a simple and delicious food. Combine them with a hefty dose of gelatin-rich bone broth, a touch of lemongrass and ginger, and you're left with a bowl of soup that beats any sugar-laden cold-pressed juice on the market.
5016054~Hamersley's Bistro Tart Dough~1487~147~0~65~116~969~316~This flaky and light pastry dough works for savory as well as sweet tarts.

5016060~Whole Roasted Cauliflower with Whipped Goat Cheese~1806~42~29~23~124~28441~226~This dish has become a signature of Domenica chef Alon Shaya. Precooking the cauliflower in seasoned poaching liquid infuses it with flavor; roasting it makes it crisp.

5016062~Roasted Barley or Corn Tea~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~Cups of this calming grain tea, extolled for its digestive properties, are poured throughout Korean meals as Westerners would provide water.

5016063~Apple and Rosemary Tarte~1276~162~10~74~81~195~225~Highly recommended!
5016064~Shrimp, Zucchini and Red Bell Pepper Bisque~2443~148~48~124~131~7600~1233~Here is a light and festive way to introduce a holiday meal. This elegant soup goes very well with Champagne.
5016065~Classic Salad~1046~76~31~12~73~594~47~We use fresh lemon juice for this vinaigrette as often as we do vinegar.
5016066~Port and Honey Poached Pears with Lemon Curd Mousse~1625~213~208~67~59~3125~210~Highly recommended!
5016067~Grilled Leg of Lamb with Ancho Chile Marinade~788~56~20~3~55~5861~0~This smoky grilled meat will be a delicious addition to your barbecue repertoire.

5016071~Squash Blossoms Stuffed With Ricotta~7451~119~22~39~786~1057~4~Talk about flower power. As every gardener knows, late summer brings a bumper crop of zucchini and, better yet, of zucchini blossoms—known in Italy as fiori di zucca. Here, the tender yellow-orange blooms are filled with ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and mint, then batter-fried. Served alongside an easy tomato sauce (dip as you like), they make an irresistible first course or, with the addition of a green salad, a satisfying main.

5016084~Apple, Apricot, and Prune Tart~4166~771~196~75~78~1179~214~The pastry for this tart is very light and crisp. For best results, handle it as little as possible and keep it cool. You will need a 12 1/2- by 1-inch fluted round tart pan with a removable bottom, available at cookware shops and by mail order from Bridge Kitchenware, tel. (800) 274-3435 or (212) 838-1901.

5016088~Steamed Artichokes with Salsa Verde~1958~88~36~12~167~1628~86~Highly recommended!
5016089~Pork Tenderloin with Date and Cilantro Relish~506~13~11~17~43~362~45~This cut of pork can be very lean, so take care not to overcook it or it will be dry. Ideally, it should still be a little pink in the center.
5016090~Pan-Seared Ancho Skirt Steak~538~33~0~0~42~0~0~Highly recommended!
5016092~Panang Vegetable Curry~1359~149~51~26~63~13220~0~Homemade Panang Curry Paste is the spicy backbone of this velvety vegetarian curry from southern Thailand. Serve it with bowls of jasmine rice for a hearty lunch or dinner.
5016093~Roast Sirloin of Beef~236~0~0~0~27~0~0~A generous sprinkling of gray sea salt provides a genuine crust. Slicing the meat against the grain keeps it juicy.
5016094~Baked Figs~250~64~46~3~0~11~0~"This recipe is a component of <epi:recieplink id=""109335"">Baked Figs with Honey and Whiskey Ice-Cream</epi:recieplink>."

5016098~Hanger Steak With Tangy Tomato Relish~674~72~28~0~39~1128~0~Hanger steak is the king of what I call weeknight steaks, casual cuts of leanish meat that deliver delicious flavor without a lot of expense or fuss. The skinny strip of flesh tastes best cooked hard and fast, for a crispy char on the outside, and left nice and pink inside. Slice it with a significant slant across the grain for the best eating texture. If you can find a grass-finished hanger steak, you’ll get leaner meat and a higher proportion of healthy lipids, such as omega-3s and CLAs. The bad news: hanger steak—or onglet, as it is sometimes known—can be hard to find. Even my regular butcher runs out somewhat frequently. Don’t fret—just substitute flank steak.
5016100~Fudgy Gluten-Free Cream Cheese Brownies~4463~565~436~56~231~2476~841~Everyone’s favorite bake sale treat goes gluten-free without any hard-to-find ingredients or alternative flours, just cornstarch and cocoa powder.

5016104~Bread Stuffing with Mushrooms and Bacon~4274~428~44~173~199~15248~761~The turkey's flavors of bacon and sage are repeated in this robust stuffing. Mushrooms, which have long been hunted in the heartland, add a nice touch.

5016111~Beet and Pear Napoleons with Ginger Juice Vinaigrette~479~48~27~0~20~179~0~"What you find here and on page 96—aside from a striking striped presentation—is an equally beautiful expression of flavors. Because both beets and pears are at the height of their season, Lee has no desire, as he says, ""to mess with them too much."" He adds, ""Nature trumps the ability of any chef."" The ginger juice in the vinaigrette is inspired by Lee's Asian roots."
5016112~Orange-Almond Cream Cake~7451~1149~847~153~320~3340~1437~Similar to zuppa inglese (an Italian trifle), this impressive dessert layers an amaretti-and-cream filling and orange segments between syrup-soaked sponge cake. Many of the components can be made ahead; start with the filling so that it can chill overnight.
5016113~Sweet-and-Sour Celery~509~42~39~0~41~3~0~Honey provides the sweet, and lemon juice the sour, in the Passover dish known as apio, which has origins in Turkey (the Ottoman Empire became a haven for Jews fleeing the Spanish Inquisition in 1492). As the celery cooks, it soaks up the braising liquid and becomes silky.
5016114~Smoked Cheese and Sausage Lasagna~2274~99~32~163~147~4117~308~Highly recommended!

5016119~Mocha Berry-Almond Smoothie~968~167~90~29~13~2430~0~This smoothie has everything you need for breakfast: Protein, potassium, Vitamin C, and coffee!
5016120~Dulce de Leche Brownies~4781~710~574~79~228~2098~922~Dulce de leche literally translates to “candy of milk.” In layman’s terms, it’s a caramel-like concoction made from boiling sweetened condensed milk until it becomes . . . well, pretty much an eighth deadly sin. What I love most about dulce de leche is that it has the beautiful color and deep flavor of caramel, but not the chewiness . . . so you don’t have to expend needless energy flexing your jaw muscles.
5016121~Lemon Charlottes with Lemon Curd and Candied Lemon Peel~4588~909~902~21~108~342~767~These individual charlottes make an impressive finale to a special dinner. Start preparing them at least one day ahead.
5016122~Roast Koji Chicken~100~23~0~1~0~5816~0~Koji—a type of fermented rice used as seasoning in Japan—makes the meat in this roast chicken more tender, crisps up the chicken skin, and lends both sweet and savory notes.

5016130~Stir-Fried Vegetables with Orange and Mint~1253~159~64~25~41~777~44~Add crunch to the meal by having rice cakes on the side. Sauvignon Blanc is a good choice to balance the flavors of the vegetables.

5016136~Kale and White Bean Stew~1360~162~37~30~46~5594~0~Adding Sherry wine vinegar and herbs at the end of cooking this vegetable stew makes the pure flavors shine even brighter.
5016138~Apple-Rhubarb Crisp~4042~612~359~47~152~4~189~Oats, brown sugar and walnuts team up with cinnamon and cloves in the terrific streusel topping for this homespun treat.

5016146~Butternut Squash Gnocchi with Sage Brown Butter~2628~258~16~163~159~7776~434~For perfect gnocchi, don't work the dough too much and add as little flour as possible. It's okay if the dough is a little sticky.
5016147~Soba Soup with Spinach and Tofu~1414~210~67~83~19~10125~28~Japanese connoisseurs of the noodle hold soba, made primarily of buckwheat flour, in particularly high regard. Here the nutty taste of the soba noodles is set off by a restorative broth in which miso is a savory option. Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5016148~Broiled Trout with Bacon, Onions, and Raisins~1224~134~94~35~62~2431~115~The sweet and savory flavors coaxed from the bacon, onion, raisins, and vinegar in this dish complement the delicate trout without overpowering it.

5016152~Quinoa Salad with Kale, Pine Nuts, and Parmesan~3931~403~8~153~208~3093~118~We love the way Dijon mustard enhances the similarly assertive flavor of the kale, while mellow pine nuts and Parmesan cheese balance it out. You can make this salad a day ahead; the flavors develop and deepen with a little extra time in the fridge. It's also delicious served warm or at room temperature.
5016153~Couscous with Dried Apricots and Pistachios~3602~423~149~90~198~4213~0~Toasted pistachios, apricots, cinnamon and allspice bring great flavor to this accompaniment for the chicken.
5016154~Homemade Ginger Beer~1015~238~238~0~0~1~0~Unlike supermarket ginger ales, which are made with carbonated water, corn syrup, and ginger flavoring, this spicy ginger beer is made the old-fashioned way, with lots of fresh grated ginger, sugar, yeast, and water. As the yeast ferments over a day or so, it creates a natural carbonation. Though many recipes leave the ginger sediment as is, we think straining it out produces a more refined quaff. For a different route to a similar drink, go to Homemade Ginger Ale.

5016160~Pisco Punch~1241~328~323~1~0~29~0~A Caribbean spin on the 150-year-old classic, this version infuses pineapple into Pisco (a South American brandy) and uses fresh grapefruit and lime peels for added brightness.
5016161~Barbecue Chicken Meatballs~1619~124~81~79~100~11952~285~If you have trouble getting the chicken mixture to roll into balls, chill it for up to 30 minutes or add another 1/4 cup of crumbs.

5016172~Gnocchi Gratin With Gorgonzola Dolce~3756~474~69~151~167~13849~522~We take potato dumplings to the next level by bathing them in cream, studding them with Gorgonzola dolce—a sweeter, milder variety of blue cheese—and topping them with crisp breadcrumbs.
5016173~Lychee Martini~235~62~62~0~0~1~0~"Enid P. Saldana of San Juan, Puerto Rico, writes: ""I would love to get the recipe for the lychee Martini they serve at Kittichai, in New York City."""
5016174~Slice-and-Bake Oatmeal Raisin Cookies~7551~1291~659~147~259~3451~876~Adding whole wheat flour ups the nutritional value and adds a nice nutty flavor.

5016183~Grilled Jumbo Shrimp with Lemon and Oregano~1648~50~11~0~165~1458~0~The citrusy dressing makes this dish a standout, and there's plenty extra to be sopped up with rice or crusty bread. Cooking shrimp in their shells keeps them juicy and tender. It all makes for casual finger food that requires plenty of napkins — which is part of the fun.
5016369~Brown Sugar BBQ Pork Butt~409~59~59~18~11~17506~54~You could bake this hunk of meat in an oven, but you'd be missing out on all that smoky flavor you'd be getting from the grill. Use this recipe for Bo Ssäm , Pork Banh Mi with Quick-Pickled Radishes and Carrots , and Summer Chef's Salad with Grilled Pork, Chicken, and Chimichurri Ranch Dressing , or just douse the meat with a little vinegar for a BBQ sandwich.
5016185~Banana Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies~3953~624~235~74~129~1335~63~Highly recommended!
5016186~Roast Salmon and Broccoli with Chile-Caper Vinaigrette~521~7~3~4~55~255~0~Giving the broccoli a head start on the salmon in this one-pan dish lets it get nicely browned, coaxing out its natural sweetness.
5016187~Strawberry Cream Cake~5594~773~442~78~252~2153~1178~The more succulent the berries, the better. The cake layers absorb the juices, which is why this cake must be assembled at least 8 hours before serving.
5016188~Braised Chicken With Chickpeas and Swiss Chard~1189~122~44~38~63~2875~62~The chicken should be falling-apart tender; if it starts to shred when you plate it, that’s a good sign!
5016189~Herb-Buttered French Bread~1275~1~0~0~139~2820~379~Serve this with chicken salad.

5016194~Roasted Beet Salad with Beet Greens and Feta~775~11~5~0~82~434~0~Good cooks never discard the nutritious beet greens. Here, the greens are combined with roasted beets, capers and feta in a Greek-inspired salad. Offer this before roast leg of lamb with crisp potatoes.
5016195~Poached Eggs on Artichoke Bottoms with White Truffle Cream and Mushrooms~1387~16~0~21~147~7213~776~Artichokes and truffle cream make these poached eggs an elegant brunch dish. If you use porcini (cèpes in French), leave the stems attached but trim the side and bottom of each stem well.
5016196~Sweet and Spicy Chipotle-Glazed Ribs~681~115~115~0~27~187~0~Look for meaty ribs that aren't over-trimmed; the bones on top shouldn't show through. This recipe doubles or triples easily.
5019801~Aviation~20~4~4~0~0~1~0~Maraschino liqueur sounds obscure but it's often hiding in plain sight. Seek it for this simple, classic cocktail.
5016199~Almond Cornmeal Cake with Peach and Berry Compote~2228~344~177~34~88~1511~585~Active time: 20 min Start to finish: 2 1/2 hr

5016203~Pear Crisps with Vanilla Brown Butter~4168~405~189~122~285~1212~428~Brown butter, infused with vanilla, adds a bewitching silkiness to the fruit that's tucked beneath the crumbly topping.

5016209~Chicken Wings with Ginger and Caramel Sauce~2765~46~6~212~182~825~862~Although the base of this fairly standard Vietnamese dish is a caramel sauce, the garlic, shallots, and black pepper cut through the sweetness like a knife, providing terrific contrast. Since the last 45 minutes of the cooking time are unattended, this is a good dish for a night on which you want to entertain.
5016210~Rhubarb-Mascarpone Mousse Cake~6019~1051~814~61~168~2016~554~A yellow cake gets filled with jam then cleverly surrounded by a rhubarb mousse by using a larger spring-form pan as a mold. A jewel-like rhubarb glaze creates a finishing touch. If you have small, early tri-star or wild strawberries to garnish the top, so much the better!
5016211~Hoisin-Marinated Pork Chops~689~90~21~39~13~14261~50~Note that the chops need to marinate for at least three days, so begin preparing this dish well in advance. What to drink: A white wine with snappy acidity and lemon-lime notes, like dry Riesling or Grüner Veltliner.
5016212~Balsamic-Glazed Salmon with Spinach, Olives, and Golden Raisins~497~29~24~17~34~407~46~This dinner for two is quick and healthy: Everything cooks in just one large skillet. And the final dish is loaded with vitamins, minerals, and omega-3s. To round out this recipe and riff on its Mediterranean feel, serve the salmon with couscous tossed with roasted pistachios.

5016220~Dry Chimichurri Rub~15~0~0~0~1~11662~1~In Argentina, this mix of herbs and spices is combined with oil and vinegar and used as a sauce for grilled meats. For best results, use dried herb leaves— not powdered or ground.
5016221~Chorizo, Poblano and Yam Fajitas with Lime-Marinated Red Onions~1809~111~30~104~108~5266~371~Here, chorizo replaces the usual steak or chicken.
5016222~Southeast Asian Rice Noodles with Calamari and Herbs~1994~48~20~74~170~4967~149~Cold noodle dishes are a great way to cool off, and since both calamari and rice-stick noodles require little cooking, the combination makes for an excellent lunch or dinner on a hot, lazy day. With its generous amount of fragrant garden herbs, this salad even smells refreshing.
5016224~Peanut-Sesame Sauce~2267~130~28~66~176~1233~0~Highly recommended!
5016225~Artillery Punch Cocktail~511~91~82~1~12~239~3~Highly recommended!
5016226~Linguine with Crab, Lemon, Chile, and Mint~1879~172~7~60~100~3025~206~To make this pasta sing, use the freshest, best-quality crab available, such as jumbo lump crabmeat, Dungeness, or king crab. Adjust the heat from the chiles and the amount of lemon juice to your liking.

5016229~Chicory and Asian Pear Salad with Membrillo Vinaigrette~1672~105~47~18~131~394~0~Membrillo lends subtle sweetness to the dressing; look for it at any well-stocked cheese counter.

5016233~Berry Tiramisu~1991~279~190~20~107~180~414~Here's a great recipe for a large group, as it can be made in quantity without much fuss. This berry tiramisù has become one of my favorite ways to show off the fresh berries of the season. If you wish, serve sliced strawberries or a compote of blueberries and raspberries on the side.
5019053~Latin Spice Mix~110~29~29~0~0~2402~0~This is used in four of the dishes in the menu; the recipe makes enough for them all.
5016237~Salad Bar Cobb~4776~98~22~210~392~10824~1517~Cobb salad was created at the Brown Derby, which opened in Los Angeles in 1926. Owner Robert Cobb placed diced vegetables, chicken and cheese on a bed of greens, and topped it all with his French dressing. Most of the ingredients for this recipe can be found at supermarket salad bars.
5016238~Poached Eggs in a Red Wine Sauce~2259~195~16~71~125~4212~626~Oeufs en Meurette
5016239~Broccoli Rabe Pasta with Golden Garlic~1713~221~45~67~56~5852~155~Broccoli rabe and pasta, crowned with golden shards of garlic and zapped with a touch of chile heat, is one of the fastest dinners to make, and definitely one of the most satisfying. Because broccoli rabe is loaded with vitamins, minerals, and cancer-fighting bionutrients, I like to double up on the greens. Those who find broccoli rabe a bit bitter—it is a cousin of mustard—will find that the bitterness is greatly tamed by boiling it in lots of salted water with the pasta. You can embellish this basic rendition with bacon or sausage, but it's pretty darn delicious just as it is.
5016240~Two-Tone Coleslaw with Celery-Seed Yogurt Dressing~929~199~141~25~1~3897~4~This pretty salad would be great alongside grilled sausages, chicken, or burgers.
5016241~Red Snapper Baked in Salt with Romesco Sauce~2189~120~21~33~180~1073359~0~The salt creates a seal around the fish, which preserves its moisture and pure flavors. Romesco is a classic sauce from the Catalonia region. For cooking the fish, use two 13x9x2-inch metal baking pans.
5016681~Vanilla-Citrus Tea Ring~5054~565~395~121~239~2128~370~Serve this tender, moist Bundt cake with the Strawberry-Rhubarb Compote , vanilla ice cream, or just on its own. Decorate with whole strawberries, if desired.
5016243~Vanilla Extract~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5016246~Punch à la Noix de Coco~457~119~118~0~0~23~0~From piña coladas to rum and coconut water, the fruit of the coco palm seems a natural pairing with the elixir of the cane reed. Here is a different twist on the rum and coconut theme—one that can be made in a larger quantity and kept on the sideboard or the bar until ready to serve. It only gets better.
5016247~Garlic Lime Chicken Breasts~604~7~2~18~55~688~45~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but may require additional sitting time.
5016248~Apple and Dried Cranberry Pie~5069~714~203~72~189~2135~516~The sweet-tart filling and the flaky crust add up to one terrific pie.
5016249~Grilled Heirloom Tomato and Mozzarella Sandwiches with Green Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho~1017~71~25~3~77~3581~126~It's hard to improve on grilled cheese with tomato soup—but that's exactly what the folks at Noca are doing. The restaurant layers red heirloom tomatoes and smoked mozzarella on the sandwich. It transforms the soup with green heirlooms—and serves it cold. The mix of flavors, textures, and colors takes this classic to a new level.
5016250~Coconut Dulce de Leche~1351~354~354~0~2~1013~0~This clever caramel sauce is made from coconut milk instead of the usual condensed milk.
5016251~Wine-Baked Halibut Steaks with Mustard-Fennel Butter~929~0~0~18~70~2632~236~These steaks are delicious served with creamed spinach and roasted new potatoes.
5016252~Pan-Fried Fishcakes~4312~851~119~176~42~2910~488~Fishcakes, like cakes of beef, would be nice served with a salad of beets and some horseradish or herb crème fraîche. Or with slaw and a spoonful of aïoli or other mayonnaise. Green beans and tomato vinaigrette?
5016254~Grilled Steak and Potatoes with Charmoula Sauce~5583~733~147~220~182~24444~408~The timeless combination of steak and potatoes gets extra pep from jarred roasted peppers and aromatic charmoula, an herb and spice blend typically used in North Africa as an instant flavor booster for grilled meats and fish.
5016255~Tilapia and Mashed Yams with Pancetta-Sage Breadcrumbs~1005~115~21~20~51~1080~119~Don't have 60 minutes to roast a root vegetable? Try cooking yams in a microwave for about five minutes on each side and you'll have yams that are soft and ready to mash—fast.
5016279~Coconut Cream Pie~7740~887~538~131~463~5914~829~An old classic that relies on a few new tricks—toasted-coconut milk, the use of gelatin, and the incorporation of whipped cream—to make the most ethereal pie imaginable.
5016257~Broiled Mustard Chicken Wings~1817~24~2~130~129~24296~518~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5016258~Fresh Spinach with Garlic-Yogurt Sauce~1085~90~12~21~67~673~41~Highly recommended!
5016259~Merguez Lamb Patties with Golden Raisin Couscous~3462~397~170~157~140~6401~459~Merguez, the spicy lamb sausages of North Africa, are popular throughout France. These nearly labor-free patties are a quick way to re-create them in your kitchen. The sweetness of the raisin couscous contrasts nicely with the meat's deep spice.
5016260~Tropical-Blend Smoothie~757~143~91~14~8~650~0~The best smoothies are made with very ripe fruit. Mango, pineapple and banana team up with light coconut milk in this one.
5016261~Meatloaf-Filled Green Bell Peppers~3646~116~16~148~290~6282~932~Highly recommended!
5016262~Chicken Fried Pork with Milk Gravy~4815~90~83~34~498~4355~96~In this recipe, associate food editor Alexis Touchet uses pork to create a new sensation based on her mother's recipe for traditional chicken fried steak.

5016268~Baked Peas with Tarragon, Yogurt, and Pistachios~1382~115~35~50~85~274~12~Frozen peas are a gift to the breakaway cook: their creamy, earthy goodness bursts with flavor, and they couldn’t be easier to store and prepare. The pesto-like tarragon emulsion, made even creamier by the addition of Greek yogurt, really brings out the best in them, and the sprinkling of pistachios on top lends a lovely toasted, nutty texture. Try them with a broiled fish fillet and a glass of grassy Sauvignon Blanc.
5016269~Hatch Chile con Queso Dip~6459~92~42~370~502~10728~1654~This silky, cheesy dip celebrates New Mexico's famous hatch chiles, which are only available in the late summer and early fall. If you are lucky enough to see them at the market, be sure to bring some home. Enjoy them right away or roast before freezing to enjoy year-round (or buy some of the great frozen options available). And skip the fancy cheese counter for this recipe: You'll achieve a smoother queso texture with super-melty cheese from the dairy aisle of the supermarket.
5016271~Garden Mint Chutney~6391~1620~1320~16~0~5749~0~Highly recommended!
5016272~Maple-Glazed Sweet Potatoes~1215~104~104~0~93~14~94~Try using Grade B maple syrup, which has a deeper flavor than Grade A, in this recipe. Look for it at natural foods stores.
5016273~Spiced Peach Pie with Buttermilk Crust~4957~932~417~84~92~1283~256~Highly recommended!
5016274~Blue-Cheese-Crusted Steaks with Red Wine Sauce~2007~121~22~80~124~15111~350~"Melanie Riggs of Jackson, Mississippi, writes: ""Last winter, I visited some friends in Minnesota. We had a fabulous meal at Redstone American Grill in Minnetonka, where I ordered an amazing steak with a blue- cheese-flavored crust."""
5016275~Ma–Po Tofu (Spicy Bean Curd with Beef)~2321~166~28~114~127~8521~78~This spicy Sichuan dish gets its layers of flavor from two different types of heat: fiery chiles and mildly numbing Sichuan peppercorns.
5016276~Walnut Chicken Salad with Green Apple Vinaigrette~1722~72~52~35~145~698~45~Although this main-course salad sounds suspiciously Waldorfesque—it includes walnuts, celery, and apple—the fresh vinaigrette gives it a modern flair that sets it apart from its mayonnaise-dressed muse.
5016280~Grilled Pita with Greek Salad~705~41~16~6~54~2831~17~Contrasting textures — crunchy salad and creamy chickpeas spread over freshly grilled pita — make this vegetarian meal something truly special.
5016281~Blackberry Mousse~2827~271~208~27~189~753~633~Fresh blackberries are plentiful in July and August, but since we must use frozen in the winter, be sure they're individually quick-frozen (available in plastic bags in the supermarket). Don't use berries packed in syrup.

5016284~Creamy Tomato Mint Soup~2031~28~11~2~226~1079~723~Although tomatoes and aromatic herbs always complement each other, tender sprigs of fresh mint seem to have a special affinity for tomatoes. In this soup the mint is a sprightly highlight that serves as a refreshing foil to the richness of the cream. Other fresh herbs, such as thyme or basil, can be substituted and the soup will still be very tasty, but you really owe it to yourself to make this recipe with mint at least once. As for the tomatoes, if it's summertime choose the ripest, freshest ones you can find (a pinch of sugar will bring out their natural sweetness); at other times of the year canned will do just fine. Serve with a basket of hot garlic bread and a tossed vegetable salad.

5016295~Avocado Tomato Salsa~545~33~13~5~43~2992~0~This salsa is delicious, easy, and versatile. I serve it with many grilled foods, including seafood, pork, and chicken. It's also excellent as a dip with tortilla chips. To preserve the salsa and prevent it from darkening, bury the avocado pits in it, cover tightly, and store in the refrigerator. It will keep for 3 to 4 days.

5016309~Garnet Yam Puree~815~0~0~0~93~39~323~The garnet yam, named for its dark reddish-brown skin, is the variety you're most likely to find in the produce section of the supermarket.

5016323~Spice-Roasted Porterhouse Steaks~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~All that these steaks need is about 30 minutes in a very hot oven: no browning, no sauce, no fuss. Improv: Try the same seasonings on two whole chickens, a pork roast, or three racks of lamb.
5017962~Zucchini and Snow-Pea Salad~1595~192~115~31~74~2063~199~Summery and light, this vivid salad and its tangy dressing help balance the tuna and its rich glaze. Salting the zucchini slices takes the edge off their rawness while preserving their pleasant snap.

5017383~Grilled Shrimp With Honey-Ginger Barbecue Sauce~649~0~0~12~68~2081~373~"Of all the ways to prepare shrimp, the grill delivers the best flavor. Although unadorned ""shrimp on the barbie"" are great, an easily assembled gingery barbecue sauce makes them that much better. You can save time by buying already shelled and deveined shrimp, but our recipe developer, Alexis Touchet, who grew up in shrimp country in southwest Louisiana, thinks shell-on shrimp are better quality. Depending on where you live and what's in your market, you may not have much choice. Freshness trumps all, so don't hesitate to use your nose in deciding which shrimp to buy."

5016341~Roasted Bosc Pears with Pomegranate Glaze~1790~269~260~50~44~2363~157~Bosc pears are distinguished by russet skins and elegantly elongated necks and stems. They are an ideal dessert pear because they hold their shape when roasted or poached. What to drink: Late-harvest Sauvignon Blanc.

5016350~Sweet-and-Smoky Baby Back Ribs with Bourbon Barbecue Sauce~1090~127~114~67~38~19441~210~To make these slow-cooked ribs, the barbecue is used like a smoker. The instructions given here are for a standard 22 1/2-inch Weber kettle barbecue. Grilling times and vent adjustments will vary with different brands of barbecues, and it may be necessary to cut the rib racks into four- or five-rib portions so that they’ll all fit on the grill. The only special equipment needed is a charcoal chimney, which is available at most home and garden stores and hardware stores.
5016351~Green Goddess Dressing~1201~19~2~30~120~1738~202~Green Goddess Dressing is a perfect example of the magic of anchovies—they amplify and deepen the herbal flavors in this sauce without ever announcing their presence. For more recipes and tips, see our Homemade Salad Dressing Primer.

5016354~Microgreens with Curry Vinaigrette~1493~14~13~0~118~1576~0~"Be sure to sample ""forest greens"" if you find them on a menu in Copenhagen—this term is not just a flight of fancy. The greens on offer there are pristine wild lettuces, herbs, and grasses growing in the mountains and on the forest floor. Since most of us don't have the opportunity to forage forest greens, we made this salad with a tangle of microgreens, which work nicely. The vinaigrette nods to the Scandinavian love for curry, but it truly plays up the flavors of the pork and potatoes as well, so feel free to drizzle it all over the plate."
5016355~Steak with Lemongrass Peppercorn Sauce~594~0~0~0~70~432~235~Parisian chefs have been seduced by lemongrass. This riff on peppercorn sauce uses vermouth instead of the customary brandy to cut the richness of the steak.

5016414~Potato Salad with Sugar Snap Peas and Mustard Seed Dressing~2610~535~110~55~12~17601~0~A simple salad with a tangy dressing-perfect for and April picnic.
5016415~Spring Berry Champagne Cocktail~740~136~126~3~21~11~0~Sliced strawberries infuse raspberry brandy with fresh berry flavor, and the strained liqueur is topped off with Champagne.
5016416~Fennel and Carrot Slaw with Olive Dressing~584~16~14~1~41~115~0~"""Ingredients are considered 'spices' in Algerian cooking,"" says Zadi, and this slaw illustrates his point, with olives contributing saltiness, carrots and sun-dried tomatoes adding sweetness, and fennel and parsley lending an incredible freshness. In the dead of winter, when vegetables are scarce, the clean flavors of this salad are as close as you're likely to get to a summertime farmers market."
5016417~Beer-Basted Chicken with Asian Flavors~258~52~38~16~0~6311~0~A sensational version of roast chicken that is great with rice.
5016418~Mussels with Parsley and Garlic~963~33~0~14~80~719~261~These mussels, flavored with garlic-herb butter and baked instead of steamed, beg for some crusty bread to sop up the wonderful sauce. Try them over pasta, too.
5016419~Baked Beans~701~162~109~5~3~1275~0~"Fèves au Lard
These beans boast two staples of Montreal cuisine —sweet maple syrup and rich salt pork."
5016422~Herb-Roasted Chicken Breasts~628~36~2~18~41~688~45~Highly recommended!
5016423~Asian Noodles with Ginger-Cilantro Sauce~597~11~3~10~52~1197~8~Add chicken or pork to turn this side dish into a satisfying main course. Chopped roasted peanuts are a nice garnish.

5016425~Asian Scallop Stew with Coconut, Ginger and Lime~55~3~1~1~3~1540~0~Serve this stew over rice or on its own as a soup. Either way, sprinkle lettuce with rice vinegar and oriental sesame oil for a light salad. Sliced blood oranges and holiday cookies will do nicely afterward.
5016426~Vegetables and Hard-Boiled Eggs with Anchovy Cream~2441~158~51~32~188~3130~810~Highly recommended!

5016431~Chicken Marsala~1216~109~4~62~85~2806~203~"Food Editor/Stylist: Paul Grimes
Father: Elmer M. Grimes, Haddonfield, NJ
My dad loved mushrooms, and he always ordered veal Marsala when we went out to restaurants. My mom didn't buy veal very often, so she adapted this recipe for chicken and made it on special occasions. He was also very fond of white Burgundy wine, which makes a wonderful accompaniment to this dish."
5016432~Coffee Granita with Sambuca Ice Cream and Chocolate Shavings~4724~798~546~125~130~14587~356~Highly recommended!
5016433~Corn and Tasso Maque Choux~915~112~42~14~42~853~110~Highly recommended!
5016434~Sea Bream with Artichokes and Caper Dressing~6167~759~167~70~294~23547~188~At Inverlochy Castle, this dish is served with spinach and sautéed mushrooms, and tender asparagus tips are scattered over the fillets as a final garnish.
5016435~Pasta with Creamy Vodka-and-Herb Sauce~1846~16~10~71~163~4022~558~Creating her own versions of restaurant dishes is a hobby of Christina's. This is her interpretation of a pasta she had while dining out in San Francisco.
5016436~Lemon Molasses Chess Pie~2412~350~318~14~112~167~662~Highly recommended!
5016437~Chilled Cucumber Soup with Smoked Salmon and Dill~1360~39~26~26~116~6103~423~To start, offer a seafood appetizer, such as chilled cocktail shrimp with herbed mayonnaise. What to drink: Pour Champagne or sparkling wine throughout the meal.
5016438~Vanilla Praline Meringue Cups with Blackberry-Raspberry Sauce~3189~319~263~62~184~967~463~This elegant dessert was inspired by Vienna's Spanische Windtorte, a giant meringue shell filled with cream and berries. The sauce is a colorful and delicious accompaniment; if there is some left over, use it on pancakes, waffles or ice cream.
5016439~Meat Loaf with Sauteed Mushrooms~2962~190~86~124~181~8722~646~Meat loaf has been a favorite throughout the century, especially during the 1940s when meat was rationed and ground beef was a bargain cut. We’ve put a contemporary stamp on this suppertime classic by adding lots of caramelized onions.
5016440~Pan-Seared Tuna with Ginger, Miso and Cilantro Sauce~296~4~3~3~29~1578~0~Using a marinade like this one is a good way to add flavor and richness to food without adding too many calories. Serve the tuna with steamed rice, and offer Japanese beer or iced jasmine tea to drink.
5016441~Shredded-Chicken Wraps with Avocado, Cucumber, and Cilantro~1433~23~9~16~141~3499~125~Highly recommended!
5016442~Baked Squash with Orange, Garlic and Parsley~712~96~0~10~29~2000~20~Highly recommended!
5016443~Porcini Mushroom Turkey with Mushroom Gravy~3320~119~8~15~284~4764~814~Both the turkey and the gravy get big-time flavor from earthy dried porcini mushrooms.
5016445~Seared Sesame Tofu with Asian Salad~1115~20~0~30~99~50~0~A purchased Asian noodle salad and crisp rice crackers are perfect with this meatless meal. Finish with slim wedges of cheesecake topped with fresh blueberries.
5016446~Beet, Avocado and Pink Grapefruit Salad with Sherry Dressing~1950~75~37~8~181~865~0~Highly recommended!
5016447~Posole with Southern Greens, Chayote, Dried Cherries, and Pecans~2125~260~175~14~115~3983~94~"Posole is a thick, hearty stew typically containing corn and pork that originated in Jalisco, Mexico. Since I wanted to make this recipe vegetarian anyway, I decided to take it in an entirely new direction. The dried cherries may seem a little odd at first, but they lend a pleasant sweet-tartness to the dish while the pecans take it a bit deeper into the South. In the United States, we call the dried posole ""hominy."""
5016448~Potato and Wild Mushroom Gratin~2815~343~22~39~112~5517~198~Haricots verts (small, thin French green beans) would also be nice as a side dish, but regular green beans would be fine, too.
5016449~Toasted Almond Mocha Ice-Cream Tart~7478~427~272~184~586~2785~695~Highly recommended!
5016451~Sauté of Fresh Fava Beans, Onions, and Fennel~568~33~16~21~46~3708~53~On the Cycladic islands, homemade salted pork flavors most vegetable dishes. Pancetta makes a good substitute here.
5016452~Spice-Rubbed Steak with Quick Garlic Fries~6249~33~0~0~709~0~0~This variation on steak frites spices up the steak and gives a garlic boost to frozen fries. You can use any packaged spice-rub mix for beef, but we use a combination of equal parts cumin and coriander, half that amount of salt and pepper, and one eighth that amount of clove. If your rub doesn't contain salt, you'll need to add some, to taste. This take on a classic meal is easy, but you will be searing the steak and frying the potatoes at the same time.
5016453~Endive, Stilton, and Bacon Salad~976~1~1~30~94~1462~115~This salad yields generous portions. Combined with a loaf of crusty bread, it’s easily a meal in itself.
5016454~Alt-Grain Porridge With Kimchi and Jammy Eggs~660~16~0~24~54~1890~455~Kimchi gives this porridge recipe a spicy twist, while the 6-minute egg keeps it hearty and perfect for breakfast.
5017415~Postmodern Pink Lady~62~13~7~1~0~42~0~Highly recommended!
5016457~Fried Chicken Salad~2467~220~14~167~164~3290~643~This recipe is a fun alternative to the heavier dishes that tend to make an appearance at Super Bowl parties. A few variations can be made to this salad as well: Make it Buffalo style by tossing the chicken in a little hot sauce just after you've fried it. You can also vary the cheese (by using goat or Feta) and other salad ingredients (like lettuce type) according to taste.
5016940~Butter Pie Crust Dough~1112~233~16~29~0~969~0~For a double-crust pie, double the ingredients, divide the dough in half, and form two disks.
5016459~Artichoke and Fennel Ravioli with Tomato-Fennel Sauce~1558~129~8~52~78~24333~24~An elegant but easy first course. Frozen artichoke hearts are used for the filling, and purchased gyoza or wonton wrappers replace homemade pasta.
5016461~Almond-Oat Lace Cookies~2422~239~178~37~158~708~211~When quickly cooked on the stove-top and then spooned onto baking sheets, this simple batter bakes into delicate lacy crisps.
5016462~Fish Fajitas~1978~78~25~147~139~4404~255~Highly recommended!
5016464~Rigatoni with Gorgonzola Cheese~4533~512~53~172~186~6756~689~Highly recommended!
5016465~Braised Greek Chicken and Artichokes~242~4~3~18~13~1257~45~It's easy to keep the Greek theme going by starting with stuffed grape leaves, widely available at supermarkets. Accompany the chicken with orzo and steamed baby carrots with mint. Finish with purchased cheesecake.
5016466~Radicchio & Carrot Slaw~200~48~41~4~0~181~0~This wonderful slaw is a great twist on classic cole slaw. If you like your slaw crunchier, make it just before the party.
5019170~Sour Cherry Compote~2424~580~492~14~0~2~0~Highly recommended!
5016468~Lobster with Sausage, Mussels, Corn, and Potatoes~4697~189~77~254~329~18352~1329~In addition to the herb mayonnaise and blue cheese coleslaw, sliced tomatoes would be perfect alongside.
5016470~Turkey Hash with Sweet Potatoes and Turnips~602~37~16~14~42~1121~145~Purchase a roasted turkey leg or whole chicken at your market. This is also a great use for leftover turkey.
5016471~Quiche in Prosciutto Cups~362~5~2~47~11~2654~98~Haute ham and eggs! These appetizers are protein-rich, and cutting out the crust makes them incredibly low-cal.
5016472~Curried Chicken Liver Pâté~940~34~25~1~88~3611~214~Highly recommended!
5019844~Sweet Potato and Coconut Soup~802~85~22~20~40~2377~0~Coconut milk is one of my favourite ingredients and it makes a fantastic creamy base for all the other robust flavours in this Asian-style soup. Choose firm sweet potatoes with orange flesh for their vibrant colour.
5016474~Speedy Pizzas~491~61~5~8~24~1439~0~Personalize these pizzas after cooking them by adding your favorite toppings, such as prosciutto, basil, arugula, or roasted vegetables.
5016475~Cheddar, Vegetable and Sausage Strata~1352~79~18~62~90~43669~654~Most of the assembly for this layered bread-and-egg dish can be done one day ahead. Serve it hot or warm.
5016476~Minted Cranberry-Lime Sparkletinis~1319~282~187~5~17~955~26~Editor's note: This recipe was created by Erika Lenkert, author of the book, The Last-Minute Party Girl: Fashionable, Fearless, and Foolishly Simple Entertaining.

5016477~Orzo with Grilled Shrimp, Summer Vegetables, and Pesto Vinaigrette~2251~181~14~130~117~1482~890~Serve this cold or at room temperature—perfect for a picnic or barbecue.
5016478~Grilled Scallops with Tomato-Onion Relish~212~49~21~29~0~2098~31~Active time: 25 min Start to finish: 45 min
5016479~Tomato, Potato, and Mustard Green Salad~4765~692~142~72~181~20419~0~Highly recommended!

5016482~Rhubarb-Gingersnap Parfaits~1914~322~297~0~71~244~235~Highly recommended!
5016483~Red White and Blueberry Sundaes~1500~186~186~0~78~29~314~Perfect for the Fourth of July. If you like, garnish the sundaes with maraschino cherries, small American flags and edible sugar stars.
5016485~Lemon (or Lime or Orange) Ricotta Pancakes~1327~202~54~46~38~2342~582~My editor, Peter Gethers, insisted on only one thing when he asked me to write this book: that I include the recipe for these pancakes. The ricotta causes them to burn more easily than other pancakes, so you need to cook them over medium-low to medium heat. If there are any pancakes that don't need maple syrup, these are them.
5016486~Crispy Noodle Pancake~1880~106~11~20~160~2093~15~Highly recommended!
5016488~Pirozhki~3118~383~135~48~147~13560~281~(Russian Potato-and-Cabbage Turnovers)
5016489~Wild Rice and Mushroom Soup~1022~152~26~22~32~1330~84~Highly recommended!

5016492~Dill-Cucumber Sauce~1450~25~6~5~152~1443~189~Highly recommended!
5016493~Apricot-Pecan Upside-Down Cake~4389~659~293~58~160~1507~781~Sweet summer apricots are a terrific topping for this upside-down cake.
5016494~Lobster and Endive Salad~1000~70~34~39~84~2415~255~This delicious salad is from Johannes.
5016496~Peach Sundaes with Bourbon-Pecan Sauce~3316~307~284~30~223~783~562~Highly recommended!
5016498~Olive-Oil Pepper Biscuits~1103~220~4~39~0~4846~0~These wine-infused, ring-shaped biscuits, called taralli, are on every Pugliese table during the antipasto course, but good ones can be hard to find in the U.S. This homemade version replicates their crisp, crumbly texture, with occasional hits of black pepper.
5016499~Black Bass with Hon-Shimeji Mushrooms, Razor Clams, and Tomato-Garlic Marinade~2848~249~42~38~231~6798~0~Highly recommended!
5016500~Roast Chicken with Herb-and-Garlic Pan Drippings~1308~83~47~0~105~35696~126~This herb-scented, brined bird packs more flavor than a basic roast chicken.
5016501~Chocolate Meringue Parfait with Chocolate Sauce~2323~370~328~19~96~541~183~Highly recommended!
5016502~White Chocolate and Strawberry Terrine with Dark Chocolate Sauce~4668~552~451~48~255~788~1097~Alternating layers of strawberry and white chocolate mousses form stripes in this creamy frozen dessert.
5019653~Mock Risotto~2049~280~6~54~78~4181~105~Unlike a traditional risotto, this easy side dish for the stew needs barely any stirring at all.
5016504~Shrimp Dumplings~503~13~2~59~19~2786~440~When we were children, shrimp dumplings were our favorite dim sum dish. The classic filling is shrimp and bamboo shoots. The dough is not difficult to make, but it is very important that the water be boiling hot. If it is not hot enough, the wheat starch will not cook and the dough will not work. Wheat starch _(dung fun)_is only available in Chinatown; regular white flour is not a substitute.
5016506~Vanilla Butter Cream Frosting~4403~946~946~0~92~969~253~Highly recommended!
5016508~Bronze and Red Lettuce Salad with Serrano Ham and Goat Cheese Spirals~1602~96~19~73~105~2014~182~Highly recommended!
5016509~Pan-Seared Tuna Topped with Fennel Salad~464~24~16~0~44~894~0~Highly recommended!
5016510~Herbed Beef and Rice-Noodle Salad~2566~257~133~158~106~5323~323~The combination of herbs, the rice noodles, and the garlicky lime sauce mark this pasta salad as Vietnamese.
5016511~Cabbage and White Bean Soup with Sausage~792~63~41~14~58~6385~0~Savoy cabbage would work well here, too.
5016512~Banana Cream Pie~3000~341~266~32~177~858~448~Few travel experiences are more American than eating dessert at a roadside diner. My order? A slice of banana cream pie: the topping whipped high, the creamy filling offering comfort far from home. To elevate this classic in my own kitchen, I add sliced bananas to the hot (and simple) custard to infuse it with flavor. And did I mention chocolate's involved? It's my take on diner deluxe. —Janet Taylor McCracken
5016513~Pear Salad with Feta, Bacon, Hazelnuts and Shallot Vinaigrette~2036~211~141~78~97~3711~240~Highly recommended!
5016514~Cream of Carrot, White Bean and Pear Soup~1257~226~115~12~28~575~92~The creamy soup would be great with large sesame-coated breadsticks and a spinach salad with marinated mushrooms. Baked apples and oatmeal-raisin cookies are nice after. This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5016515~Zucchini Pizza Crust With Lemony Pea Pesto~4475~393~172~100~267~3103~682~Zucchini is a surprisingly chameleon-like vegetable—I find myself using it frozen in morning smoothies, pureed in desserts, and, now, grated in pizza crust! Zucchini pizza is a great way to sneak in extra servings of vegetables, and it is naturally lower in carbohydrates and higher in fiber compared with traditional crusts.
5016517~Black Bean Chili with Butternut Squash~1254~217~18~41~21~2798~0~"Home turf: California
Local flavor: In health-conscious California, chili is as likely to be made without meat as it is with it. No self-respecting Texan would sign off on chili with beans, squash, and bulgur—but this lean, mean dish is as delicious as it is healthful.
Make it a meal: continue the Cali fantasy with whole grain bread, an arugula salad with mushrooms and garlicky vinaigrette, and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (California, $8 per six-pack)."
5016520~Tea-Smoked Chicken~110~29~29~0~0~4846~0~Highly recommended!
5016521~Pan-Fried Lamb Chops with Rosemary and Garlic~418~9~0~0~42~30~1~These easy lamb chops are just right for a quick dinner. Pair them up with the mashed potatoes and some boiled green beans. Pour a full-bodied Merlot or Pinot Noir.
5016522~Plums with Prosciutto, Goat Cheese, Baby Arugula, and Champagne Vinegar~1065~14~10~71~85~2933~248~Chef Scott Boswell of Stella! in New Orleans keeps it simple: Sweet plum wedges are served with greens, goat cheese, and a bright vinaigrette.
5016523~Raspberry Shrub~434~31~27~0~32~801~0~This puckery, sparkling aperitif is booze-optional.
5016524~Slow-Cooked Ratatouille Over Goat Cheese Polenta~3380~345~24~105~169~22507~492~Parmigiano-Reggiano adds salty, nutty richness to this ratatouille, which rivals the best oven versions. To speed preparation, feel free to skip the first step of salting and rinsing the eggplant and zucchini (this process draws off any bitter juices). Instead, just remove any particularly seedy and brown parts of the eggplant, or use smaller Japanese eggplants (which also do not need to be peeled). For pizzazz, add chickpeas and pitted, chopped oil-cured black olives. To make this dish vegan, swap in olive oil for the butter and skip the cheese (adding olives will make up for cheese's saltiness).
5016525~Leg of Lamb with Mint Pesto, New Potatoes and Baby Carrots~3777~632~304~25~136~1429~0~Highly recommended!
5016526~New England Seafood Chowder~7586~1065~303~411~178~25298~1136~Whether they feature shellfish, smoked fish or fresh fish, chowders are an essential part of New England cooking. Ours is prepared with a mixture of fresh cod, haddock and halibut, three important North Atlantic ocean varieties. We've made the surprising addition of butternut squash and kale--both popular regional vegetables--to this hearty soup for extra color and texture. Curry powder lends an unexpected bit of spice.
5016527~Zingerman's Ann Arbor Mushroom and Barley Soup~7366~432~173~164~562~126623~151~When I first heard about Ari Weinzweig's delicatessen in Ann Arbor, Michigan, I couldn't believe it. A deli in the home of my alma mater. It's not really a deli but more of an international food emporium like New York's Zabar's with a definite Jewish touch. Mr. Weinzweig, a drop-out Ph.D. candidate, has taken an academic and appetizing interest in updating Jewish recipes like mushroom and barley soup, going back in history to the nineteenth-century Eastern European version similar to that served at New York's Second Avenue Deli.
5016528~Soft Manioc Polenta~426~86~19~5~3~3741~0~Pirão
5016529~Roast Cornish Game Hen with Spring Vegetables~768~90~32~20~28~2318~0~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5016530~Red Velvet Cake with Raspberries and Blueberries~7028~1183~971~137~208~2956~876~This cake is a southern tradition for festive occasions. It can be completely assembled and chilled one day before serving.
5016531~Sauteed Carrots with Red Bell Pepper and Dill~597~65~32~15~31~1335~63~Highly recommended!
5016532~Veal Chops with Eggplant and Pepper Stuffing and Roasted Red Pepper Sauce~1631~189~25~35~90~4689~0~Highly recommended!
5016533~Cuban Special~318~108~1~1~0~392~0~Highly recommended!
5016534~Green Tea And Ginger Beer Float~335~26~21~10~20~239~76~Chill glasses in the freezer for 5–10 minutes to keep the ice cream from melting into the ginger beer too quickly.
5016535~Turkish Coffee Pudding~2341~148~118~9~212~370~892~A bit of cardamom gives this dessert its exotic flavor. The pudding needs to chill about five hours before serving, so be sure to plan ahead.
5016537~Caramelized Chocolate, Banana, and Marshmallow Sandwiches~1348~209~105~25~37~1191~78~This fun, gooey treat makes a great after-school snack. The marshmallows are slightly charred and the bread is cleverly caramelized for double the toasty flavor.
5018974~Juniper-Brined Roast Turkey with Chanterelle Mushroom Gravy~1105~52~11~1~95~966~253~Living in the Pacific Northwest, with our bounty of berries, tree-ripened fruits, hazelnuts, and wild mushrooms, makes going to the farmers' market feel like a season-long treasure hunt. I'm especially rewarded when I stop at the mushroom forager's stand and see a basket chock-full of chanterelle mushrooms. At the peak of the season, I buy fresh chanterelles and use them as often as I can, as in this golden-hued mushroom gravy accompaniment to the holiday bird.
5016539~Grilled Rib-Eye Steaks with Parsley-Garlic Butter~1024~33~0~28~104~879~334~The garlicky herb butter is similar to the butter served with escargots in southwestern France. IMPROV: When preparing the butter, try a shallot instead of garlic, and thyme instead of parsley.
5016540~Blackberries with Mint Tea Syrup and Yogurt~528~135~88~6~0~0~0~Depending on the flavors and types of tea your kids like, feel free to experiment.
5016541~Cold Tuna Niçoise~593~56~34~13~33~7283~47~Highly recommended!
5016542~Pasta with Tomatoes, Mozzarella and Basil~2322~301~20~91~95~1461~120~(PASTA CAPRESE)
5016543~Corn and Winter Squash with Spinach and Bacon~1337~175~54~47~53~1462~115~A lovely dish that's a snap to prepare.
5016544~Sicilian Fisherman's Stew~2333~244~26~68~127~5385~254~Fish stews abound throughout the Mediterranean and most evolved from the fishing boats themselves, as fishermen reserved the worst of their catch for themselves and cooked it on-board.
5016546~Spinach and Tofu Paneer~480~69~16~5~19~3477~59~For a long time it seemed to me that there was more than a superficial resemblance between the white Indian cheese called paneer and tofu. When I finally made the classic Indian dish of spinach and paneer using tofu, it tasted amazingly at home in the cumin, ginger, and chile-laced sauce. There's a little going back and forth between the skillet and a food processor, but this is an easy dish to make. I serve it over rice with a sprinkling of toasted black sesame seeds.

First of all, you can't beat freshly steamed artichokes—nibbling the flesh from the little leaves, gobbling the tender heart. And the insanely good anchovy butter has absolutely no relation to the too-salty fish you may have had once at a takeout pizza joint. Instead, oil-packed anchovies contribute this subtle sea-salty punch that you just can't get from anything else.

5016672~Baby Tomato and Fresh Goat Cheese Salad~1856~216~54~93~64~3559~171~"This is an early signature dish of my colleague Jonathan Waxman, who has been at the center of the contemporary American food scene since the early 1970s, when he worked at Chez Panisse in Berkeley and at Michael's in Los Angeles. Waxman now presides over Barbuto—he's ""the bearded one""—in the far west Greenwich Village, where all- American inclinations meet simple Italian cooking, frequently in the wood- burning oven. Jonathan's cooking has always been defined by its clarity; there are times when I wonder how he has managed to make something as simple as a roasted chicken or a plate of beets seem so special. Top-quality ingredients in season and vigilant preparations are the answers—what I strive for in my own cooking. This dish is a classic example of the early wave of what was known as the New American Cooking—a movement, if not a revolution, now forty years old and counting. It also demonstrates that a new, even trendy, dish can endure and become a classic—if it has integrity. Nevertheless, you can improvise here. Change the herbs according to what you've got, and the oils for the dressing."

5016693~Lamb Bulgogi with Asian Pear Dipping Sauce~3065~441~255~53~103~8512~81~Bulgogi (grilled marinated beef) is a traditional Korean dish. Here, lamb stands in for the steak. The meat is served with lettuce leaves and other veggies, hot pepper paste, and a slightly sweet dipping sauce. Guests use all of the ingredients to assemble their own lettuce wraps, which is a common practice in Korean restaurants. Timing note: The lamb needs to marinate for at least four hours.
5016694~Winter Vegetable Roast with Maple-Mustard Vinaigrette~443~95~39~5~0~40662~0~Why do I love roast winter vegetables? For starters, because they are fresh, local, and seasonal. Unlike summer produce, they keep for a long time without losing most of their flavor. They feel like winter food: hearty, substantial, rib-sticking. Francis Mallmann quick-roasts them at very high heat in a wood oven until they almost burn. A home oven doesn't put out that kind of thousand-degree heat, but when something as simple as slices of Delicata squash are coated with a little bit of olive oil, sprinkled with kosher or coarse sea salt, and then roasted, they come out of the oven chewy, nutty, sweet, and savory. Part caramelization, part umami, and part Maillard.
5016695~Eggplant Parmesan Rolls with Swiss Chard and Fresh Mint~1460~28~4~133~98~4758~665~The Original: Breaded, fried eggplant with a thick oregano-flavored tomato sauce. Our Version: Broiled slices of eggplant wrapped around a mint-and chard-flecked ricotta filling.

5016699~Eggplant, Potato and Pepper Casserole~5212~1056~206~101~48~31152~0~Majorcans love to talk about the quality of their vegetables, and this dish of sautéd eggplant, potatoes and bell peppers in fresh tomato sauce, called tumbet, is one of their favorite creations. We suggest serving it with grilled fish or lamb chops, as Majorcans do.
5016700~Smoked-Salmon Crêpe Torte~942~135~35~63~42~1023~471~Layers and layers of thin, tender whole-wheat crêpes and smoked salmon make a stunning multilayered cake-like torte. To serve, cut into small wedges for an appetizer or into slightly larger wedges to accompany a salad.
5016702~Veal Osso Buco~3658~184~34~118~304~6680~224~"I open the braising chapter with one of Italy's most renowned braises: osso buco. It's a classic Milanese dish usually made with veal shanks cooked in a rich broth that includes tomato and wine. I salt the meat before cooking it, a technique that tenderizes the veal. The dish is finished with lemon zest and parsley, which stand in for the more common gremolata that often accompanies it, along with saffron risotto. The term ossobuco roughly translates to ""hole in the bone"" or ""pierced bone."" I suggest you tie the shanks before cooking them so that they hold together—and don't forget to dig into the bones for the luscious bone marrow."
5016703~Layered Vegetable Salad with Caper and Thyme Dressing~5417~939~281~106~132~18148~196~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5016705~Asiago Cheese with Glazed Cipolline Onions~1751~194~163~58~81~2651~249~This cheese course is one I frequently serve to guests at home, and every time it's enthusiastically received. Asiago is a little softer than aged Parm, with a nutty, sweet flavor that is gorgeous with glazed onions. I also find it's a fantastico red wine cheese, and goes quite nicely with a dessert Sauternes.
5016706~Lowcountry Aïoli~3486~49~1~22~366~4645~542~Louis Osteen makes his mayonnaise fresh, but we've substituted bottled mayonnaise to avoid raw egg yolks.

5016710~Endive and Arugula Salad with Pickled Onions and Blue Cheese~5915~475~398~80~426~6536~299~It's best to divide this salad between two bowls; put one on the buffet table, and keep the other refrigerated until you need it later in the party. Make the pickled onions at least one day ahead.

5016717~French Fries~19416~672~134~67~1908~20175~0~The trick to french fries is double-frying. First, flash-fry the potatoes to eliminate moisture, then fry them again to ensure crispness. Eating them with mayonnaise will take you to Europe.
5016718~Chile-Cumin Lamb Meatballs with Yogurt and Cucumber~3647~311~168~135~205~11447~467~Mullen serves these robustly flavored meatballs as a shared plate at El Colmado, his New York City tapas bar, but they're also a great main.

5016739~Rum-Raisin Chocolate Brownies~6239~1025~773~52~234~1083~898~"""When I lived in South Africa, rum and raisin chocolate bars were a special treat,"" says Beth Peterson of Phoenix, Arizona. ""I created this brownie recipe based on that combination of flavors, and perfected it with the help of friends and colleagues who sampled the brownies at each stage of development. These have a grown-up taste with the right balance of sweetness and rum."""
5016740~Tomato and Spinach Soup~1319~19~9~38~117~2177~380~Highly recommended!

5016749~Grilled Chicken with Almond and Garlic Sauce~2963~136~18~35~249~3692~0~For the best flavor, marinate the chicken overnight. If you're short of time, use a 15-ounce can of cannellini or lima beans instead of the dried beans. With this rich, garlicky sauce, you need only a fresh salad to complete the meal.
5016750~Bob's Sweet-and-Sour Grilled Jumbuck Ribs~429~69~59~3~13~2253~0~This one honors our longtime barbecue buddy, the late Bob Carruthers, of New South Wales. We met Bob during his first trip to Lynchburg, Tennessee, to serve as an international judge at the Jack Daniel's World Championship Invitational Barbecue. From then on he played a significant role in introducing Australian barbecue to Americans and American barbecue to Australians. His footprints on The Jack will endure, as will many good memories of the fun and enthusiasm he brought to the event. For this one we recommend Australian lamb ribs, and the whiskey has to be Jack Daniel's. Life is sweet. Life is sour. Life goes on.

5016770~Spumante-Vodka Cocktail with Lemon Sorbet~924~149~121~0~33~212~120~This refreshing cocktail can be a dessert, but it is also a great brunch drink. In Italy, Lucia likes to use Italian sparkling wine (such as spumante) instead of Champagne.
5018540~Chicken Salad with Roasted Root Vegetable Vinaigrette~541~23~14~91~4~3312~212~This is a great way to use up leftover roasted vegetables and chicken and turn them into a light salad. The roasted veggies are more interesting the second time around in a vinaigrette as opposed to just on their own. Even when I don't have leftover roasted veggies, I have been known to toss some raw ones in the oven just to make this delicious dressing, which I eat on everything: pasta, grilled fish, and, obviously, chicken. The chicken for this salad can be warm or cold, straight from the fridge.

It is delicious eaten as is or in sandwiches, salads, or stir-fries. Serve hot or cold.

5016812~Planked Figs with Pancetta and Goat Cheese~1198~73~54~62~82~2118~212~Naturally sweet, fresh figs get an all-over taste treatment with tangy goat cheese, smoky pancetta, slightly bitter fruit liqueur, and heat from black pepper. Serve these figs as finger-food appetizers or place them on top of dressed greens for a salad. High-heat planking caramelizes the figs and burnishes the goat cheese, adding another level of flavor. The high heat cooks the fruit quickly, resulting in an outer charred fruit and warm center that has texture and bite but is not mushy. This is an excellent way to plank most fruits and vegetables. Keep a spray bottle of water handy to lightly douse flare-ups.
5016813~Sweet Potato and Apple Dressing~391~29~18~0~33~1800~0~This easy dressing makes a great side dish for roast chicken or fried pork chops.

Or, if you have a neighbor with one, you're bound to find a bag of persimmons on your doorstep one fall day. The prolific trees are especially striking when the leaves drop and the traffic-stopping bright-orange orbs are still clinging to the bare, gnarled branches, silhouetted against a clear autumn sky.

5016835~Cherry, Pistachio & Coconut Cake~5713~601~456~123~332~1689~584~We do vary the fruit on top, so we use red plums or yellow plums or raspberries, but really the cherries are the best version. The contrast between the cherries and the green pistachios, and the addition of mahleb to the cake batter, together create something electric.
5016836~Pineapple, Mango and Papaya Squares~5424~815~760~5~232~746~632~Similar in texture to lemon bars, these have a shortbread cookie base and a delightful tropical fruit filling.

5016844~Fresh Herb Frittata~504~23~9~14~38~203~452~This is one of the real classics of [Friuli-Venezia Giulia] cuisine. You will find it wherever you travel, especially in springtime when wild herbs sprout in fragrant profusion all over la terra fortunata. The key here is to use as large a variety of herbs, grasses, and greens as you can locate. It is traditional that there be at least five different types. Among the most famous are silene, hops, melissa, mint, verbena, basil, marjoram, sage, parsley, spinach (just a little), fennel leaves, Swiss chard, zucchini (courgette) flowers, wild fennel, beet greens, chervil, sorrel, and celery leaves. This frittata is served piping hot, tepid, or cold. As always, it should be covered if allowed to cool, and cut into wedges before serving.
5016846~Chez Gladines' Basque-Style Scrambled Eggs~1582~77~36~58~111~3153~581~This Basque specialty consists of scrambled eggs garnished with tomatoes, peppers, onions, and a slice of ham.

5016851~Shaved Carrot and Radish Salad With Herbs and Pumpkin Seeds~2358~119~73~98~173~3397~0~This salad highlights the many green herbs that are an essential part of Persian cuisine, especially in spring when they are just coming into season. This salad is a crunchy, raw counterpoint to a rich Passover meal, and while some seeds are not eaten on Passover, pumpkin seeds are okay, since a pumpkin is not a legume.

5016858~Lemon-Garlic Lamb Chops with Yogurt Sauce~1285~143~47~29~57~943~90~The sautéed fennel and carrots is an excellent accompaniment to these chops. Boiled potatoes and sautéed greens would also be a good match.
5016859~Rhubarb Sorbet with Gingered Orange Compote~2735~656~644~1~0~29~0~Orange juice and pomegranate juice enhance the light sorbet. The compote would also be good over store-bought strawberry sorbet or ice cream.
5016860~Wax Bean, Pea, and Chorizo Salad~1266~86~44~52~88~810~74~Chunks of chorizo balance the sweetness of spring onions, beans, and peas. A Sherry vinaigrette lends a slight Iberian edge.
5016862~Steamed Fish with Lime and Chile~446~105~66~3~0~1940~0~This is the definition of minimalist Thai cooking. The steam not only gently cooks the fish until just tender but also creates an instant, complex sauce from a handful of basic ingredients. Scoring the fish's flesh allows more of the flavor to season the fish and facilitates faster steaming. The fish is cooked on a plate that fits inside the steamer, to catch the juices.
5016865~Sweet-and-Sour Brisket~1042~189~124~8~30~1005~101~Here's an easy dish to cook ahead for company. Serve it with buttered noodles or mashed potatoes, then add a vegetable to round out a comforting meal.
5016866~Pinto Raisin Bread Pudding with Apples and Cheese~4315~739~543~23~155~1569~259~"If mention of ""pinto"" brings to mind pink beans, think again this time: The following ""pinto"" bread pudding contains none of those beans beloved of chili fans but is named for the distinctive calico splotches that pattern the West's pinto pony."

5016874~Nectarine-Raspberry Pie~1889~466~377~14~10~118~0~This pie rivals peach pie for flavor and texture. The double-crust pie is piled high with lush tart nectarines interspersed with raspberries. The flesh of a nectarine is slightly firmer than that of a peach, producing a pie with an excellent texture.

5016876~Halibut with Red Bell Pepper and Olive Relish~750~53~8~18~60~1377~49~"Jason Gareffa of Los Angeles, California, writes: ""Pursuing a career in acting keeps me tremendously busy. Between my improv comedy classes, performances, auditions for film and television roles, and gigs as a DJ for weddings, I don't have a lot of extra time on my hands. But good food is important to me, especially since I need a lot of energy to stay on the go. So over the years, I've started experimenting in the kitchen. Now the other members of my improv group even like to come to my 'wrap parties' to taste my creations."""
5016877~Xuxu and Shrimp with Chile and Lemon~1381~52~9~144~69~3102~1321~Crisp chayote goes by a raft of different names, but its Brazilian one, xuxu, was the inspiration for this quick stir-fry. The dish's vivid good looks echo its primal shout of flavor. After the shrimp, xuxu, and hearts of palm are cooked, they're tossed with a raw sauce of garlic, onion, jalapeño, and lots of lemon juice, which keeps everything sparkling and very fresh-tasting.
5016879~Faux-Fried Onion Rings with Smoky Mayonnaise~2482~581~50~159~0~1121~13~Giving foods that glorious crispy- crunchy texture without a deep fryer isn't easy. The best way to healthfully approximate the deep- fried experience is to use panko breadcrumbs, a mist of cooking spray, and a hot oven. Panko is a Japanese ingredient that used to be found only in Asian supermarkets and health- food stores but is now available everywhere. The crumbs are made from crustless bread, so they're lighter and crunchier than traditional breadcrumbs.
5016880~Veal Scallopini with Olive and Sun-Dried Tomato Sauce~380~49~0~106~87~467~222~Sweet sun-dried tomatoes and earthy black olives enliven thin veal slices with the vibrant flavors of a sunny coast.

5016883~Pork Tournedos with Blackberry Gastrique and Mango Salsa~321~28~28~0~23~484~63~A gastrique is a mixture of caramelized sugar (or, in this case, sweet preserves) and vinegar often used in savory dishes made with fruit.
5018775~Citrus-Sage Roast Turkey Breast with Gravy: Small Crowd~1161~36~11~29~102~683~331~If you're sharing Thanksgiving with a smaller group, we highly recommend a turkey breast. You'll still end up with plenty of leftovers for what many consider the best perk of the Thanksgiving holiday: the day-after turkey sandwiches.
5016885~Pasta with Arugula Purée and Cherry-Tomato Sauce~2015~104~0~15~171~3418~0~In this easy and hugely satisfying pasta dish, arugula is transformed from peppery leaf into powerhouse pesto.
5016886~Fuji Apple Spice Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting~12016~1948~1389~107~451~3248~1129~Why Fujis? This not-too-sugary cake (inspired by carrot cake) is best when made with fairly sweet apples. Plus, it's important to choose an apple variety with a sturdy structure so that it won't break down during baking. Fuji apples fill the bill on both counts.
5016887~Lime Almond Cheesecake~7170~593~538~86~497~3308~1492~Highly recommended!

5016890~Chile-Rubbed Shrimp with Avocado Corn Cocktail~330~0~0~21~28~1979~194~I've never quite understood the appeal of the traditional shrimp cocktail. I mean, what could be less interesting than cold boiled shrimp dipped in a lackluster mixture of ketchup and prepared horseradish? Here's a shrimp cocktail with gumption, featuring chile-rubbed, grill-seared shrimp served over a colorful, chunky salsa of avocado and sweet corn. You can chill the grilled shrimp before you serve them, but I like the contrast of hot shrimp and cool salsa.
5016891~Beer and Molasses Barbecue Sauce~99~15~15~1~0~2123~0~A tangy sauce for grilled chicken or spare-ribs. Build up a shiny glaze by brushing the sauce often over the meat, beginning about 15 minutes from the end of cooking time.

5016901~Egg, Potato, and Prosciutto Pie~1329~121~20~55~70~4535~469~"""Simple, simple, simple! Just throw it in the oven and jump in the shower."" That's how food stylist Toni Brogan described this savory pie, a favorite in her native New Zealand. And it really is that easy—just line a pan with puff pastry, fill it up with onions, thinly sliced potatoes, and, in place of the usual bacon, prosciutto (left over from Ravioli with Green Beans and Prosciutto ), then crack some eggs on top and cover with more pastry. By the time everyone is out of the shower, the pie is ready to come out of the oven, all golden and flaky on the outside, layered with deliciousness on the inside. Though it's traditional to serve the pie with ketchup, we love it with some spicy chutney on the side."
5016902~Bouillabaisse~2740~219~67~102~162~20356~577~We won't dispute that Guillaume Sorrieu's bouillabaisse, from L'Épuisette, in Marseille, is the best of the best, but where does that leave the home cook with no access to fresh seafood from the Mediterranean? The trick is to look for the freshest local fish you can find and not to be afraid of improvising. That's what we've done here (forget serving the dish in two courses). The fish remains firm, the broth clear, the flavor sublime.

5016924~Curried Sweet Potato Pancakes~740~104~27~28~18~4145~24~"On one of my first trips to India, at a bus stop in Poona, there was a street stand where the vendor was roasting potatoes over charcoal, chopping them, and tossing them with curry spices and crispy onions. He served the mixture wrapped in a piece of newspaper. It was amazing, and it inspired this dish.
There are so many curry spice mixtures from around the world. This recipe employs one of the most common. You can use either yams or sweet potatoes in this recipe."

5016954~Veal Shank with Balsamic Onions and White Beans~570~72~33~2~1~2512~1~For a low-fat entrèe, be sure to remove all visible fat and membrane from the veal shanks. Tie them to retain a nice shape.
5016955~Sausages with Caramelized Red Onions and Radicchio~279~22~19~1~20~95~31~Radicchio's bitterness is a nice match for the slightly sweet sausages. Serve this hearty dish with crusty bread or with pasta tossed with olive oil, garlic, and chopped Italian parsley.

5016973~Linguine with Spicy Tomato and Clam Juice~1665~234~7~56~59~2639~63~This is as delicious with mussels as it is with clams. Offer a simple green salad afterward, and pears and a wedge of Italian cheese for dessert.
5016975~Almond Cookie Cups with Sauternes-Poached Apples and Frozen Sauternes Mousse~2000~310~305~9~78~195~318~Highly recommended!
5016976~Cuban Avocado, Watercress, and Pineapple Salad (Ensalada de Aguacate, Berro, y Piña)~800~70~30~0~55~1961~0~Watercress is the green of choice in Cuba, its peppery taste a perfect foil for the avocado and the sweet pineapple in this classic Cuban salad. I serve it with shrimp in a spicy tomato sauce called enchilado de camarones. In Cuba, the pineapple is never roasted, but this technique adds another dimension of flavor I find very appealing.
5016977~Ramp and Sausage Risotto~2087~219~13~127~80~5728~181~Sweet sausage will workin this springtime risotto, too; the final result just won't taste spicy.
5016978~Chewy Coconut–Chocolate Chip Cookies~3350~475~222~50~138~4756~281~For these ultra-chewy and tender cookies, I started with the traditional chocolate chip cookie, took out some sugar and half the butter (but left enough to keep it delicious!), swapped the flours, and added oats and shredded coconut, which toast and caramelize to give the cookies an extra chewy texture.
5016979~Sausages with Sherry Caramel Glazed Pears~3444~146~133~104~265~5325~555~The combination of sweet and savory from pears and sausage is just what you want to take the chill off an autumn evening.
5016980~Honey-Glazed Duck with Fig and Pistachio Red Quinoa~3264~414~188~109~146~2567~139~This is one of my favorite recipes in this book, mainly because of the fun evening I had developing it while visiting my dear friend Kevyn in New York City. I prepared it in his kitchen while he and our mutual friend Jennifer looked on, sipping wine. We enjoyed the meal with a bottle of Côtes du Rhône wine and then, with dessert, drank port left over from the recipe. This is one of the most elegant dishes in the book, and while it's by no means difficult to prepare, it's an indulgent recipe that is ideal for a special occasion or a dinner party.—JH

5016989~Onion Tart with Mustard and Fennel~1545~274~81~129~33~6155~109~Simple savory tarts abound in Provence. A particular favorite includes slow-cooked onions, mellow and nearly as sweet as marmalade, punctuated with hints of the herbs that grow wild all over the region—in this case, fennel. Cooks are known to vary their crusts depending on the affair, from short, buttery versions to pizzalike yeast crusts; the latter is used here to keep the tart light.
5016992~Caramelized-Onion and Parmesan Cream Scones~3759~11~5~189~328~15937~1102~An Italian twist on an English favorite.

5017001~Sunshine Cake~2166~235~178~46~134~1289~623~Even in its simplicity, there's something about this buttery almond cake that just feels special. Baking it in a pie dish allows for you to serve it straight out of the vessel, whether for breakfast or a mid-afternoon snack, accompanied by nothing but a steaming cup of coffee or tea.
5017002~Warm Goat Cheese Salad with Dried Cherries and Pancetta Vinaigrette~1338~101~80~32~91~900~119~Highly recommended!
5017003~Spicy Oven-Fried Chicken~3354~275~53~71~118~8600~156~Don't be intimidated by the amount of hot pepper sauce in the marinade; the chicken will pick up only some of the heat.

5017016~Baked Mushroom-Sesame Rice Balls~2892~344~0~61~150~788~0~This spin on onigiri, Japanese sticky white rice balls, combines the earthiness of brown rice and mushrooms with the crunch of a sesame seed crust. The key is cooking the rice until it releases all of its starch, then chilling it in the fridge so you can easily roll it into balls before baking.
5017017~Lemon-Anise Flan~2598~541~539~28~27~563~443~Highly recommended!

5017022~Mom's Coleslaw~1354~228~159~23~34~7252~18~My mother always made wonderful side dishes — and made them look so easy. Indeed, they were! A few fresh vegetables, great herbs, a little mustard or vinegar, and kosher salt were all it took for her to make something taste like it came right from the garden. Here's her incredibly simple recipe for coleslaw — a step removed from traditional recipes that are typically bland and smothered in mayonnaise, this slaw is sharp and crunchy and great with salads, roast meats, and sandwiches.
5017023~Asparagus and Goat Cheese Frittata~1753~98~25~35~149~43793~453~When I put these ingredients in my rice cooker, I knew the flavors would complement each other, but I wondered what the dish would look like. It was lovely! The soft, melting goat cheese mingled with the asparagus and creamy eggs. The frittata makes a great light supper or lunch dish; serve it with a fruit salad.
5017024~Mustard-Crusted Tofu with Kale and Sweet Potato~1329~82~19~14~91~4290~0~Highly recommended!
5017025~Giant Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup~7031~760~626~157~399~3903~166~What makes classic peanut butter filling in chocolate cups irresistible is the edge of salt against sweet. That and a texture that hovers between creamy and crumbly. To get more peanutty goodness—and a tastier homemade version of it—blitz up peanuts, sugar, and salt and stuff it into a huge tart pan lined with chocolate. It's as addictive as the original with a freshness from just-ground peanuts.
5017026~Pernod Cocktail~218~86~0~0~0~1~0~Highly recommended!
5017027~Roast Goose with Chestnuts, Prunes and Armagnac~2373~173~125~126~117~13843~399~In most of France, turkey with chestnuts has become a standard Christmas dish, but in the southwest, goose is preferred.
5017028~Pan-Seared Pork Tenderloin with Rhubarb Compote~2025~0~0~253~122~6326~658~Orzo with lemon zest and Italian parsley would be lovely alongside. What to drink: Viognier or French Chardonnay.
5017029~Grilled Chicken Moroccan Style~2446~30~23~51~243~5801~196~Start marinating the chicken four to six hours ahead. Pour frosty Pilsners or a chilled Chenin Blanc.
5017031~Middle Eastern Lamb-Stuffed Zucchini with Yogurt Sauce~1743~186~88~61~84~4038~192~Highly recommended!
5017032~Chickpea Salad With Lemon, Parmesan, and Fresh Herbs~507~68~3~5~19~270~0~The beauty of this basic recipe is that it can be tweaked in numerous ways. For a spicy version, add some sriracha sauce. Try swapping out the lemon juice for lime juice and use feta cheese instead of Parmesan and mix in some chopped fresh cilantro and chopped red onion or shallot. For a curried chickpea salad, leave out the Parmesan and add curry powder to taste, dried currants, sliced green onions, and shredded carrots.
5017033~Pineapple Rum Trifle Cake~176~9~9~12~10~1109~370~Highly recommended!

""Of all the great meals we had there, a few stand out in my memory. One was at Buca Mario in Florence. The rosemary-scented bean soup was unforgettable."""
5017035~Crunchy Fried Shrimp with Cayenne Aïoli~1250~120~0~154~13~2587~1321~This starter gets a double dose of cayenne — in the cornmeal coating for the shrimp and in the garlicky mayonnaise dip.
5017036~Herbed Chickpeas~259~48~0~4~1~246~0~Crispy, salty, creamy, and full of protein (really!), these chickpeas should be a staple in your kitchen.
5017038~Creamy Wheat Cereal with Maple Syrup and Bananas~1749~265~218~27~72~1546~56~Pass a pitcher of cold low-fat or nonfat milk to drizzle over this cereal.
5017039~Smoked Salmon Quiche With Kale and Basil, and Sesame Seed Crust~1625~143~16~97~103~1761~601~I have written many quiche recipes and usually they are mushroom with a little ham, but smoked salmon in a quiche gives a lot of flavor and works beautifully with the basil.
5017041~Three-Bean Salad with Coriander Chili Dressing~3073~203~17~48~239~2005~0~Highly recommended!
5017042~Brandied Apricot Beignets with Chocolate Dipping Sauce~4473~545~273~60~235~1948~925~Brandy and apricots amp up the flavor of these fritters. The finishing touch? A dark-chocolate sauce.
5017043~Whole Baked Salmon~272~15~11~3~27~4~0~For a quick sauce to go with the fish, whisk together sour cream, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard and chopped fresh dill.
5017044~Pear, Cherry, and Pine Nut Tartlets~1840~327~226~22~48~533~4~The crusts for the tartlets are as simple as frozen puff pastry cut into small rounds.
5017046~Carrot with Toasted Almond Soup~2805~389~251~30~122~6010~226~The secret to this simple recipe is using the best carrots you can find; taste them to make sure they are sweet and full of flavor.

5017048~Skirt Steak Fajitas~404~4~0~18~34~596~48~Skirt steak, which is full of flavor and holds marinades well, is the essential beef cut for fajitas.
5017050~Two-Potato Sauté with Bacon and Cream~4359~720~147~109~104~23974~193~This smoky, creamy combination of white and sweet potatoes may be the ultimate Thanksgiving side dish.
5017051~Roast Chicken With Lemon and Butter~1413~22~9~16~121~5700~195~Everyone should know how to roast a chicken. It's a life skill that should be taught to small children at school. The ability to properly prepare a moist yet thoroughly cooked bird, with nicely crisp skin, should be a hallmark of good citizenry—an obligation to your fellow man. Everyone walking down the street should be reasonably confident that the random person next to them is prepared, if called upon, to roast a chicken.
5017052~Sauteed Baby Artichokes with Oven-Dried Tomatoes and Green-Olive Dressing~1950~172~10~57~113~25816~0~Unlike their big brothers, baby artichokes are almost completely edible and require minimal preparation. For this first course, sautéing the artichokes instead of steaming adds good flavor. Some people don't like to have artichokes with wine because they can make the wine taste either metallic or strangely sweet. In Italy, though, artichokes and wine are usually served together. A crisp, steely Pinot Grigio does the trick.
5017054~Green Beans and Celery Root Salad with Mustard Vinaigrette~3699~295~75~45~257~2900~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5017060~Smoked Salmon and Leek Scramble with Meyer Lemon Crème Fraîche~2527~85~31~40~221~3716~1050~Improv: Instead of smoked salmon, try this with a generous dollop of caviar on the eggs, or top them with smoked trout or whitefish.
5017061~Poached Asian Pears with Star Anise and Tropical Fruit~1554~345~231~5~3~1530~0~"Light, refreshing and very sophisticated. Asian pears have a crisp texture, a round shape, and a sweet and floral aroma that's quite unlike that of the more familiar buttery ""pear-shaped"" pear."

5017075~Peanut Noodles with Shrimp~889~110~25~57~15~44771~217~Want to feel alert and energized? Repeat after us: protein, protein, protein. Here's a way to get lots of it, with very little saturated fat. (For an equally high-energy vegetarian version of this dish, substitute 12 ounces firm tofu, drained and cut in 1-inch cubes, for the shrimp.)

5017086~Pan-Roasted Chicken with Harissa Chickpeas~569~59~8~20~24~2307~89~Harissa is a great shortcut ingredient to flavor, but no two jars (or tubes) are the same. Taste first—if it seems very spicy, use a bit less. You can always stir more into the chickpeas when the dish is finished.
5017087~Roasted Sweet Onions with Cabrales Blue Cheese~2168~31~9~53~211~1069~112~If Cabrales is difficult to find in your area, it can be ordered on-line from tienda.com. Italian Gorgonzola can also be substituted. Serve the onions and the Roasted Red Peppers with Garlic with plenty of crusty bread. What to drink: Albariño.

I always thought its true home was around Columbia, South Carolina, and the lower upstate area. But then I saw a pimiento cheeseburger on the menu in a wonderful burger joint and restaurant called Litton's, in Knoxville, Tennessee, so I guess a good idea can cross state lines. So here's how to do it, complete with a little pimiento cheese recipe, but the burger's not bad even if you have to use a good-quality store-bought pimiento cheese."

5017233~Buckwheat Shortcakes with Earl-Grey Apricot Compote and Whipped Cream~3171~305~192~7~235~2274~770~Here at Epicurious, we're big fans of the nutty, fruity buckwheat-biscuit shortcakes in Alice Medrich's cookbook, Pure Desserts. So we created a version we can enjoy all year long. Cooking dried apricots in Earl Grey tea with a vanilla bean infuses them with sweet spices that pair nicely with the earthy bitterness of buckwheat flour. Don't forget to freeze the butter for 1 hour before grating.

5017237~Barbecue Rub #67~476~119~118~0~0~47739~0~After a lot of years of making barbecue rubs, I've used up all the good names, so sometimes I just use numbers now. Numbers 67 and 68 are a little tip of the hat to the band named after my hometown, Chicago. This one is a great all-around rub for the new barbecue cook because it's good on just about everything.

5017242~Quince, Ginger, and Pecan Conserve~2251~468~460~8~56~1286~0~"In this recipe we slowly ""double-cook"" the quince, which prevents the fruit from crystallizing and heightens the pinkish- orange color it turns when cooked."
5017243~Kimchi Fritters with Soy Dipping Sauce~1416~116~44~44~80~4466~60~Korean pickled cabbage, a.k.a. kimchi, provides the spice in these savory fritters, while soaked raw mung beans hold the flourless pancakes together. They're great with or without the dipping sauce and pickled pears.
5017244~Sesame Seared Tuna with Vegetable Slaw~1641~185~122~37~93~1178~40~Mischa Barton and Kate Beckinsale have spent time in the Santa Monica steak house with a funky decor (picture mirrored walls and antler chandeliers). Atkins devotees can be spotted chowing down on red meat, while vegetarians can sample plenty of fish recipes like this tuna dish, which is high in omega-3 fatty acids (they may help reduce your risk for heart disease).

5017254~Poached Chicken, Crunchy Vegetables, and Herb Dressing~2365~129~34~47~181~2835~93~I used to be put off by poaching chicken as I feared it was more complicated than my simple fried version. But it's actually much easier, because while the chicken poaches you can prepare the rest of the food. These days I often poach 3 or 4 chicken breasts at a time, then keep them in the fridge so I can toss them into salads over the following days. Poaching really helps to keep the moisture in the meat, so the end result is much more enjoyable than dried, overcooked chicken.
5017255~Cold Poached Salmon with Mustard-Lime Sauce~935~30~22~7~35~6187~0~Highly recommended!
5018955~Green Beans with Caramelized Pecans~931~81~62~9~58~2074~158~Green beans have a certain suave, slender elegance that makes them a classic accompaniment to rosy-red roast beef. But too often, they get short shrift: a quick drizzle of butter, a squirt of lemon, and onto the table they go. We suggest you coddle them a little this year. Try tossing them in a hot skillet with shallots and pecans that get caramelized in buttery brown sugar, and you'll see just how special green beans can be.
5017260~Spiced Apple Cake with Eggnog Sauce~6976~1002~764~138~345~3436~1202~A moist, deeply flavored confection studded with rum-soaked raisins and crunchy pecans, this streamlined one-bowl cake will get compliments even for novice bakers. Plus, it keeps for days. To dress up each serving, why not use store-bought eggnog, which has the consistency of custard sauce.
5017261~Grilled Ham and Chimay Cheese Sandwiches with Caramelized Belgian Endive~1114~40~37~8~102~1201~96~"Chimay ""À La Bière"" cheese is a Belgian smooth semisoft cheese that is washed with Chimay beer. It has a pungent aroma and mild flavor. Look for it in specialty cheese shops or on amazon.com or igourmet.com, or try another cheese with a beer-washed rind, such as German Temptin cheese."

When Marty gave Ardie [Davis] a taste of CAM Onions at the 2008 Great American Barbecue, Ardie said, ""You've gotta give me your recipe for the next KCBS cookbook!"" Marty gladly obliged. He adapted this from Rick Browne's Oz Onion Pudding in Rick's Grilling America book (2003). Rick gave us permission to share this version, tweaked by Carolyn Wells, Amy Winn, and Marty Lynch—hence the CAM acronym."

5017294~Triple-Cherries Jubilee~3388~572~454~35~101~917~359~Flaming desserts-like this one and crepes suzette-were all the rage at fine dining establishments in the sixties. The title here refers to the sweet cherries, dried cherries and cherry juice-enhanced by vanilla bean and orange peel-that provide such terrific flavor.

5017297~Oranges in Red Wine~49~12~8~0~0~1~0~The kitchen was the domain of Miraglia Eriquez's grandmother, but this recipe was her grandfather's specialty. Sitting at the dining table, Poppy, as he was known, would peel and cut oranges, toss the pieces into glasses, and cover them with red wine. After the oranges soaked up and sweetened the wine, he would eat forkfuls of the fruit, then down the drink. It was—and is—the perfect prelude to dessert.

5017300~Spicy Adobo Shrimp Cocktail~631~82~24~86~4~1730~660~Shrimp cocktail quickly becomes much more than a classic first course when you give it some Latin flair. Try tossing lime juice, cilantro, piquant adobo sauce, and creamy avocado into the mix.

5017304~Curried Yogurt Dip with Crisp Steamed Broccoli~1198~192~103~67~6~1377~56~Start making this dip one day before you plan to serve it, since the yogurt has to drain and thicken overnight. A piece of cheesecloth is needed for the first step of the recipe.
5017305~Baked Potatoes with Rib-Eye Steak Hash~1737~117~22~12~141~3681~441~This recipe takes a classic hash and turns it inside out — the potatoes aren't used in the hash, but under it.

5017319~Strawberry-Kiwi Sangria with Rosé Geranium~3827~1295~473~0~0~0~0~This sweetly refreshing summer cooler contains no alcohol, but the wild-berry tea and pureed strawberries give it that sangria color. For guests who prefer their beverages a bit more spirited, B. Smith recommends adding white Muscat or light rum to taste.
5017320~Orange-Scented Bluefish~499~90~90~4~13~381~0~"Bluefish is remarkably delicious and versatile. It is wonderful on the grill, its fatty richness complemented by the flavor of wood smoke. That richness (""oiliness"" to the minds of some) causes many people to shun bluefish and other similar ocean brethren. All I can say is, oh well, more for me. Here orange zest provides an acidic tang that helps to balance the flavors, and the slow, low heat of the smoldering wood cooks the fish without drying it out."
5017321~Polenta with Mascarpone and Parmesan~323~12~4~17~21~624~86~Versatile store-bought polenta, turned cheesy with mascarpone and Parmigiano, is the simplest way we know to make cornmeal mush sexy.

There are pockets of cream cheese throughout this savory mixture, the key to creating them is keeping the cheese cold until it is folded into the eggs. Be sure to have plenty of coffee and an assortment of teas on hand to complete the meal.

5017337~Turkey Club Salad with Avocado and Mayo~2292~94~61~142~143~4790~441~A classic American sandwich gets a makeover: The avocado dressing has an inviting creaminess to it, and the crunchy grilled croutons are a revelation.
5017339~Spiced Kumquat Chutney~2118~534~500~2~0~917~0~Try this one with turkey (it's also a nice accompaniment to pork or roast duck). Terrific for gift giving when packaged in a decorative jar.
5017340~Melon Salad with Arugula, Fennel, and Marjoram~616~46~19~16~41~2074~0~The combination of melon, marjoram, and sweet moscato vinegar in this delicate salad tastes like summer to me.

In the Epi test kitchen, we're partial to New Orleans-style brews, such as Grady's, which—blended with chicory—are super smooth and lightly sweet.
5017345~Basic Beer-Can Chicken~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~"Here's a grilled chicken technique that's become a cult hit with backyard barbecue masters. For luxe and delicious twists on the technique (from the Japanese-flavored ""Roppongi Roaster"" to the Italianate ""Toscana in a Can""), see the article ""Beer Can Chicken Goes Upscale"" in the Starters section of the August 2005 issue of Bon Appétit."
5017346~Roast Goose with Oranges and Madeira~1201~230~178~6~23~3852~62~The goose is blanched briefly and then chilled for two days before roasting to ensure a crisp skin. Offer buttered peas and carrots with the goose, and pour a Pinot Noir. A pear tart would end the evening in style.
5017347~Winter Vegetable and Beef Soup~5332~728~243~216~182~97466~176~"George Hendrix of Carbondale, Colorado, writes: ""My family is usually in a hurry to eat, so dinner has to be on the table fast.

5017369~Grilled Sausage Sandwiches with Fennel and Sweet Onion~463~61~13~2~26~1751~0~Frances Foley—mother of Gourmet's freelance photography assistant, Stephanie Foley—found that when she grilled an entire coil of Italian sausage, everyone clamored for the well-browned outer ring. Rather than draw straws, Mrs. Foley now grills individual small coils so each person gets their own crispy edge to savor. We've used her method as the basis for these meaty sandwiches, and piled on some of our own quick-cooking toppings.

5017372~Pomegranate Gelato~2237~257~233~3~144~255~485~The pomegranate is a fall and winter fruit, so this gelato is appropriate for the season. Refreshing without being heavy, it has a beautiful blush-pink color, and the tanginess of the fruit cuts the richness of the dairy. The result is an irresistible autumnal dessert you won't soon forget.

For a garnish, we like the looks of fresh berries, but we used frozen berries in the filling to keep it moist. They're also more uniform in flavor--and less expensive.

5017395~Maple-Glazed Roast Turkey with Mixed-Herb Gravy~5571~748~62~142~217~15566~302~"In early spring, colonists would tap into sugar maple trees to draw off the smoky-sweet syrup, which was a substitute for expensive imported sugar. Here, the syrup is brushed onto the turkey to add a deep golden finish. New Englanders liked their gravies rich and dark, and often kept a box of browned or ""scorched"" flour on hand to aid in browning, as well as flavoring and thickening. This delectable gravy borrows that technique. Be sure to start the gravy early in the day."
5017396~Fettuccine with Shiitakes, Peas and Prosciutto~2712~338~6~92~84~3754~325~In addition to the shiitake mushrooms called for here, look for morels, porcini or even button mushrooms, all of which are available during late spring early summer months.

5017419~Warm Potato Salad with Watercress~1541~125~53~7~111~3917~0~Adding watercress to potato salad gives this old standby new life. We particularly like the contrast of the crisp, peppery green against the warm, vinegar- and mustard-spiced potatoes.
5017420~Tequila-Glazed Chicken with Jalapeño~294~70~60~0~0~3677~0~Why you'll make it: Because it's that one easy, really delicious recipe for barbecued chicken that every cook needs.

Rub spices on the chicken at least six hours ahead.
5017421~Plum and Mascarpone Pie~922~106~56~11~47~1006~94~Use plums that hold their shape when cooked, such as black or red (avoid soft-fleshed Santa Rosas). If you prefer a taller pie, use all 5 pounds of fruit.

5017428~Honey-Roasted Carrots with Tahini Yogurt~414~46~42~1~27~23828~0~"The inspiration for this was Sarah's grandmother (""nan"") Dulcie in Tasmania, who always used to add some honey to the pan before roasting her carrots. I'm not sure what Dulcie would have thought about a tahini yogurt sauce served alongside, but the sweetness of the carrots certainly welcomes it. Make this extra vibrant by using different-colored carrots."

5017433~Stuffed Turkey Breast With Butternut Squash, Kale, and Sausage~3892~319~20~130~231~22169~485~For maximum juiciness and flavor, pound and season the turkey breasts 24 hours in advance. Swaddling the breasts in butter-rubbed cheesecloth and cooking them in a roasting pan with broth yields a tender, succulent result. This turkey roulade recipe is perfect for a crowd, but is easily halved to feed a smaller crew. Serve a rich gravy alongside.
5017434~Roast Pork with Cabbage and Caraway~823~71~20~10~53~12809~9~Highly recommended!
5017435~Crispy Spring Rolls with Spicy Tofu, Vegetables, and Toasted Nuts~1310~257~13~31~29~1324~0~I love visiting Buddhist temples in Asia, not for religious reasons but because I enjoy the food served in their restaurants. This recipe was inspired by the fried vegetarian spring rolls I ate at the Shaolin Temple.
5017436~Grilled Spiced Lamb Chops with Cucumber-Mint Sauce~551~67~29~16~18~1467~49~Look for red curry paste in the Asian section of the supermarket. Serve with: Lentil and rice pilaf and sautéed mixed vegetables. Dessert: Sliced papaya and mango.

5017442~Grilled Steak Salad with Tomato Vinaigrette~534~125~14~58~0~3462~0~A great summer salad requires three things: fresh greens, a tart, seasonal dressing (made here with grated tomato), and a light hand to toss the ingredients together so the lettuces stay perky.

5017444~Fresh Boysenberries with Black-Currant-Tea Crème Anglaise~705~83~76~32~23~904~89~This delightful custard sauce-infused with black currant tea for a unique accent-is made with milk instead of cream. Begin preparing it a day ahead.

5017447~Orange Coeurs à la Crème with Strawberry Raspberry Sauce~504~60~43~13~21~474~78~You can find the Neufchâtel cheese called for here next to the cream cheese at your supermarket.
5017448~Cilantro-Lime Crab Salad in Avocado Halves~691~13~3~53~48~1554~286~This springtime dish would go nicely with sliced red and yellow tomatoes drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette; offer corn muffins, too. End the dinner with wedges of chocolate mousse cake.

5017453~Roasted Potato Wedges with Cilantro-Lime Mayonnaise~4427~688~140~68~149~21056~126~Thick-cut seasoned potatoes can be roasted along with tortilla chicken drumsticks . The mayonnaise works as a zesty dip for both, so you may want to double the amount.
5017454~Mozzarella in Carrozza with Anchovy Sauce~8768~272~43~82~789~8342~685~Miraglia Eriquez's Aunt Dottie loved this indulgent appetizer, which was served at her favorite Italian-American restaurants. A talented, ambitious home cook, Dottie tinkered in her kitchen until she came up with her own version. We're glad she did. The lemon and capers in the anchovy-butter sauce cut through the richness of soft, stretchy mozzarella in a pocket of crisp fried bread.

5017456~"Honey ""Tree Bark"" Biscuits"~4854~372~170~160~368~3486~691~The trees of Hansel and Gretel's forest surely had bark like this, sparkling with sugar crystals and tasting of sylvan honey. Though the biscuits pair wonderfully with blueberries in gin syrup, they also make an excellent accompaniment to a cheese course—particularly with a nice triple-crème.
5017457~Sliced Chicken Salad with Chili-Ginger Vinaigrette~620~90~51~35~0~8168~45~Some of the chicken's flavorful poaching liquid gets added to the dressing in this spicy Asian-accented dish.

5017463~Annabel's Baby Back Ribs~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~Provide knives so your guests can slice the sections into individual ribs. Have lots of damp paper towels on hand.
5017464~Mushroom-Thyme Pot Pies~2699~311~20~138~169~9354~260~Brushing the underside of the dough with egg wash for this pot pie recipe creates an airtight seal so that steam will push the pastry lids into a dramatic dome during baking.
5017466~Pimm's Royale Punch~1316~325~278~5~0~528~0~Who says that Pimm's is just for Pimm's Cups? Add Champagne, and it becomes an especially refreshing punch. Pimm's was created in the 1840s by an English oyster bar owner, and it became one of the most popular beverages in England. The exact recipe is a secret, but we do know that it is a gin-based liqueur flavored with spices and fruit. It is generally consumed in the Pimm's Cup with ginger ale and a fancy fruit garnish. This party punch takes it one step farther, letting it macerate with fruit and then adding Champagne rather than soda.
5017469~Curried Smoked Turkey and Fruit Salad~3338~267~175~103~218~5127~280~This refreshing dish is perfect for a luncheon and is a snap to prepare. You can purchase thick slices of smoked turkey at your local delicatessen.

5017472~Mini Corn Dogs~10558~141~25~115~1108~5857~337~These are no ordinary corn dogs. The fragrant buttermilk-cornmeal batter is laced with a hint of honey, spices, and delicious crumbles of bacon.

5017478~Brown Sugar-Chipotle Salmon with Honey-Berry Glaze~468~67~54~1~23~4067~63~"Jan Schroeder of Corvallis, Oregon, writes: ""A great thing about my job is that I get to do a lot of cooking.

5017480~Melted Swiss Cheese with Vegetables~2779~81~32~218~194~2027~606~In this simplified version of raclette, one of Switzerland's classic dishes, Swiss cheese replaces raclette cheese, and the cheese is melted in individual portions instead of being scraped from a large wheel as it melts. This dish makes a terrific appetizer, or it can be served with a green salad.
5017481~Spicy Beef Curry~1824~176~27~32~106~39876~10~The curries that are sold in the markets of southern Thailand inspired this heavily spiced dish. Chef Boetz says this delicious main course is a hybrid of an Indian and a Thai curry. The use of dried spices (coriander, cardamom, cumin) is common in Indian curries; coconut milk and fresh, aromatic ingredients (cilantro, lemongrass, galangal) are often used in Thai curries.
5017482~Gyoza (Japanese Dumplings)~886~85~3~44~40~5147~57~I still have fond memories of learning to make these with my mum in our kitchen.

5017483~Herb Green Beans with Feta~1107~84~48~5~78~1004~0~When it comes to buying feta, you've got choices. We love the firm texture and sheep's-milk tang of Bulgarian or Greek.

5017486~Strawberry Rhubarb Cobbler with Cornmeal Biscuit Topping~2933~500~249~40~38~2915~94~The cornmeal biscuit topping adds some crunch to the winning combination of fresh strawberries and rhubarb.
5017487~The Original Three-Ingredient Rub~16~3~0~0~0~0~0~Good for Seasoning: Flank steak; pork; chicken; salmon
5017488~Yellow Pepper and Corn Salad With Turmeric Dressing~1098~128~12~11~56~1433~0~The pepper skins add smokiness to the salad, so don’t peel them. Bonus: That makes life a lot easier.
5017489~Scalloped Potatoes and Parsnips~763~141~54~21~10~3089~35~In the following recipe, scalloped potatoes, often soaked with cream and cheese, are combined with parsnips and cooked with broth and low-fat milk instead. Though lighter, they are still delicious.

5017491~Strawberry Sundaes with Prosecco Sabayon~4209~561~480~68~200~961~201~Not your average sundae: Strawberry sorbet takes the place of ice cream; Prosecco sabayon (an airy, foamy custard) is the sauce; and sugared almonds add crunch.

5017496~Smoked Salmon, Fennel and Goat Cheese Toasts~1322~15~7~91~108~2312~313~Goat cheese and fennel prove to be the perfect partners for smoked salmon. Pour glasses of Champagne or Sauvignon Blanc.
5017500~Curried Squash~316~27~19~0~23~3011~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5017501~Sweet Stuffed Capon~2284~144~21~105~138~2696~375~You can easily recreate this recipe with a wonderful free-range chicken. As for the candied chestnuts, I recommend using freshly cooked, shelled chestnuts which are still quite sweet!
5017502~Roasted Cod on Saffron Mashed Potatoes~4008~682~141~72~96~20245~157~This bright and sophisticated dish is offered at Gresslin's in London, England.
5017503~Soba With Green Chile Pesto~719~126~31~16~9~1761~10~The key to cooking with chiles is to think of their heat not as a dare but as another essential building block of flavor, right alongside salt, acid, and fat. Rather than overpowering a dish, a perfectly calibrated prickle of spice enhances the other elements and wakes up the palate.
5017504~Strawberry Prosecco Soup~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5017505~Vermont Cheddar Cheese and Herbed Twists~2008~38~0~107~161~2995~443~Purchased puff pastry simplifies this flavorful starter. What to drink: Open a bottle of Champagne or Sancerre to pour with the cheese twists and the Corn and Lobster Chowder.
5017507~Creamy Cilantro-Lime Slaw~1616~145~75~27~101~1919~126~The slaw would be perfect with grilled pork or lamb, or use it as a topping for fish tacos.
5017508~Rum-Raisin Apple Cake~8604~1250~763~111~359~3213~370~"Selma Hurwitz of Potomac, Maryland, writes: ""I'm an artist, and I think that without question cooking is very creative. You can't be afraid to experiment in the kitchen. I often get ideas from cookbooks and recipes from friends, and I'll add my own touches. The apple cake is inspired by a cookbook from Michigan — I just added more rum and spices. Both recipes are great for company and freeze beautifully."""

5017538~Pineapple-Marinated Salmon with Asian Cabbage Salad~327~25~12~21~13~3485~46~Look for black sesame seeds in the Asian foods section of a specialty market. If you can't find them, use white seeds instead.

5017545~Caramel Apple Pastis~3413~431~343~50~177~862~214~This beautiful pastis — a sweet phyllo-wrapped pie that evolved in southwest France from the savory meat-filled _b'stilla_s of Morocco — makes an impressive holiday dessert.
5017548~Indonesian Fried Noodles~3346~397~37~94~143~6360~874~Bahmi goreng
5017549~Roasted Squash with Mint and Toasted Pumpkin Seeds~1527~123~38~31~104~2270~20~Use butternut squash or a small, firm cooking pumpkin such as a sugar pumpkin for the best results.
5017551~Fish Steaks Braised with Bell Peppers, Olives, and Lemons~1803~92~11~10~136~6026~0~Braising is an excellent way to keep fish steaks moist and flavorful.
5017553~Pear and Cranberry Cobbler with Citrus-Infused Custard Sauce~3242~575~401~70~127~1820~377~A cobbler is the easiest way to get to something similar to a pie—meltingly tender and juicy fruit with a crusty topping—without having to make, roll out, and crimp pie dough. Biscuit dough, in general, is easy and fast to assemble, but the cream dough below is a real cinch because you don't even have to blend butter into the flour mixture; you just pour in heavy cream and stir, then pat it out with your hands. A round cutter is your default shape but feel free to rummage through your cookie cutter collection for something fun, such as a leaf or diamond.
5017554~Baked-Potato Buttermilk Biscuits~2633~270~40~130~98~6469~252~I have a love of potatoes that is unlike any other love. I grew up eating them often as a kid—almost every day—so now I’m always looking for new ways to incorporate this versatile vegetable into my everyday life. There’s just something so special about biscuits loaded with shredded potatoes, cheddar cheese, and chives. I can’t put it into words, but I feel like I don’t have to because you get it. It’s the baked potato you never knew you wanted . . . in biscuit form.
5017556~Spicy Chicken Peperonata with Lime and Mint Dressing~989~37~10~19~82~1321~45~Peperonata—an Italian condiment usually made of sautéed tomatoes, peppers, onions, and garlic—is spiced up with a poblano chile. Here, we've added chicken breasts to turn it into a satisfying main course. Serve Italian-style, over polenta, or Mexican—style, wrapped in warm tortillas with slices of avocado and dollops of sour cream. Instead of chicken, you can also spoon the peperonata over grilled flank steak or crusty grilled bread.
5017557~Baked Apples Stuffed with Honey, Almonds, and Ginger~1935~145~119~40~136~556~157~These are unusually light, with a crunchy filling. A dollop of thick, tangy Greek yogurt is a nice finishing touch.
5017558~Shrimp with Romesco Sauce~904~80~3~36~45~880~194~You can steam, grill, boil or broil the shrimp or, even easier, buy them already cooked. Saffron rice and greens mixed with some olives, red onion slices and a garlicky olive oil dressing are perfect side dishes. Sliced oranges sprinkled with a bit of sweet Sherry and paired with some crisp sugar cookies would round out the Spanish-inspired menu.
5017559~The Great Onion Soup~1791~236~133~55~65~32418~100~The recipe calls for both chicken broth and beef broth, but using either one or the other will give an equally good result.
5017560~Ranchero Beef Stew~1860~94~33~117~75~16408~340~Traditional beef stew with Spanish overtones. It's delicious over rice or pasta.
5017561~Eggs Carbonara with Basil and Parmesan~1003~8~1~43~87~2659~565~"Michele Verdi-Knapp of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, writes: ""The best eggs I have ever tasted were at Seven Gables Inn in Pacific Grove, California. Thank you for the recipe."""

5017564~Saffron Rice Pilaf~4569~784~171~109~132~1612~0~The color yellow symbolized joy for medieval Arabs, who were cultivating saffron in Spain by 960 c.e. Sephardic Jews were equally inspired by the coveted spice, and golden rice became a holiday and Sabbath tradition. This version, made with basmati rice, is punctuated by caramelized onion, currants, and fried almonds.

5017573~Goat Cheese with Chipotle and Roasted Red Pepper~1578~47~8~18~145~2086~92~Highly recommended!
5017574~Anything Goes Donabe~3315~356~150~172~104~55472~318~Chicken, seafood, glass noodles, and vegetables get briefly poached in dashi-based broth. Cutting the ingredients into uniform pieces ensures they cook in the same amount of time.
5017575~Lamb Stew with Turkish Flavors~6290~896~396~255~189~29006~768~The mild heat and deep flavor of Maras and Urfa peppers are wonderful not just in kebabs but also in soups and stews.
5017578~Sweet Blini~1974~280~120~63~95~1345~612~Unlike savory blini, crêpes traditionally served with butter, caviar, and sour cream, these are stuffed with fruit preserves, making them ideal for dessert.
5017580~Chive Shortcakes with Smoky Corn and Okra Stew~4516~715~36~179~204~5175~456~Comfort food, August-style: A creamed-vegetable stew tastes mighty fine ladled over pillowy biscuits dotted with chives. A store-bought smoked turkey leg deepens the stew's flavor almost effortlessly—its bone and skin go into making the broth (along with the corn cobs and silk), and its meat is stirred into the stew.
5017583~Arugula-Chicory Salad with Pine Nuts and Goat-Cheese Toasts~1277~30~19~43~118~72000~119~The contrast of textures and flavors—crunchy pine nuts, creamy goat cheese, acidic tomatoes, and spicy arugula—adds complexity to this simple salad. It makes a great side dish to steak or chicken or a light lunch for two.
5017584~Corny Polenta with Watercress and Gorgonzola Salsa~1495~219~32~42~46~2522~94~Consider this delicious dish as a vegetarian main course, too.
5017585~Puffed Rice and Coconut Crunchies~900~130~22~14~34~268~0~Try these sprinkled on peanut butter toast or stirred into plain yogurt that's been seasoned with fresh lemon juice and salt.
5017586~Brined and Roasted Rosemary-Chile Almonds~4174~109~21~153~373~2083~0~Brining the nuts with herbs and some spice infuses them from the inside out, and the long roasting time gives them extra toasty flavor.
5017588~Zucchini in Tomato Sauce~889~83~34~6~55~2261~44~Highly recommended!
5017589~Hot-and-Sour Peanutty Noodles with Bok Choy~2295~247~36~70~100~8363~0~Traditional Asian meals tend to be full of veggies, and this one won't disappoint. Also, peanuts provide protein and off-the-chart levels of resveratrol, the same heart-smart compound found in red wine.
5017592~Pizza with Sausage, Sauerkraut and Swiss Cheese~2086~52~7~159~144~6452~315~Lots of fun: pizza with flavors reminiscent of the classic Reuben sandwich.
5017593~Oatmeal Coconut Raspberry Bars~3118~723~360~98~22~976~0~Highly recommended!
5017594~Ravioli with Herbed Walnut Sauce~1951~58~6~25~160~1884~126~This rich, satisfying main course would be nice with a salad of chopped fresh tomatoes, yellow bell peppers, black olives, and sweet onion. Crusty breadsticks round out the meal, which might end with a plate of assorted grape clusters and anise biscuits.
5017595~Creamy Southwestern Potato Salad~5115~876~159~101~92~22042~63~A bold medley of cumin, cayenne, corn, and cilantro ups the flavor here. Great with: Grilled-fish tacos, steak fajitas, or chipotle-rubbed chicken.
5017597~Parmesan Sage Polenta Sticks~1660~0~0~94~148~5971~450~Although traditional Italian polenta is simmered for nearly an hour, resulting in a very creamy consistency, for the following recipe we preferred the more rustic texture of this quickly cooked version.
5017598~Ginger Champagne Cocktail~162~0~0~0~0~0~0~Bubbly with benefits? Ginger may help prevent cancer by halting abnormal cell growth. (We'll take two!)
5017599~Grilled Chicken Thighs~295~42~0~19~0~9462~0~Dark meat stands up nicely to bold Asian flavors.
5017600~Boiled Carrots with Prepared Horseradish~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~This is especially pretty made with a mix of orange and purple carrots, and even nicer if you flute the carrots lengthwise with a channel knife before slicing them—this results in slices with pretty scalloped edges. A channel knife is handy for cutting decorative strips of citrus zest, too; you can pick one up in nearly any gourmet shop.
5018707~Golden Scalloped Potatoes~3878~739~185~87~54~20648~119~Think of this as a streamlined and guilt-free version of scalloped potatoes. It's a toss-and-dump dish, in which I toss sliced potatoes with a little melted butter, dump them in a dish, then cover them with milk—healthier than heavy cream—that I've thickened slightly with a bit of flour (the flour keeps the milk from separating). The cheese topping is optional; with or without it, in less than an hour you will be rewarded with lusciously creamy potatoes along with that all-important browned crust.
5017602~Rosemary Trout with Cherry-Tomato Sauce~652~35~24~3~55~95~0~A couple of rosemary sprigs are all you need to flavor each whole trout. Serve with tabbouleh.

5017605~Asparagus Wrapped in Serrano Ham~999~72~43~17~73~913~0~Try this tasty, nutritious combination from Gene Briggs, executive chef of Blue and Table restaurants in Charlotte, North Carolina. Folate in the asparagus helps prevent anemia; grapes contribute good-for-your-heart flavonoids.
5017606~Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce~1303~183~75~66~25~5764~94~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are from The Shun Lee Cookbook by Michael Tong.
5017607~Classic Champagne Cocktail~400~100~100~0~0~0~0~The champagne shines through in this classic—with a hint of added flavor from spirits, bitters, and citrus peels. Many variations of this recipe are served at hotels and bars worldwide.

5017609~Three Berry Butter Cake~5339~978~454~95~113~2276~663~This cake, bursting with berries, is perfect for a picnic. Dress it up for company with unsweetened whipped cream and a simple vanilla custard sauce.

5017614~Linguine with Shrimp and Plum Tomatoes~7984~648~67~563~398~15518~2556~Pasta with shellfish is an old Italian tradition. Have crusty bread on hand to serve.
5017615~Pop's No-Cook Barbecue Sauce~1338~78~33~39~88~7420~105~Brush this peppery sauce onto beef, chicken or pork during the last 15 minutes of grilling.
5017616~Sardine Toasts With Tomato Mayonnaise and Fennel~1963~90~21~13~181~1618~126~Chef Renee Erickson has access to the best seafood anywhere; when it comes to sardines, she goes with Matiz sardines in olive oil.
5017617~Beer-Braised Hot Dogs with Braised Sauerkraut~677~133~55~13~4~5258~7~The combination of sauerkraut, sausages, and mustard is well loved in Germany—and beyond. Here, dark beer enhances the sauerkraut, and the hot dogs are simmered in fruity Belgian lambic.
5017618~Cargamanto and Green-Bean Salad with Chimichurri Dressing~1372~79~6~13~110~891~0~This simple salad is designed to highlight the delightful spotted cargamanto beans. You can use either the red or white variety; both lose their mottled colors when cooked. Because these beans are so meaty, we use a dressing inspired by chimichurri, the Argentinean sauce for grilled meats.
5017620~Soy-Pickled Jalapeños~131~18~12~13~2~8031~0~"Green chiles pickled in soy sauce and vinegar are a traditional Korean banchan, so food editor Lillian Chou, who created this menu, was surprised when she discovered a similar dish made with jalapeños and soy sauce at a taco bar in Mexico. But it's no wonder the combination has universal appeal. Here, Chou calls for brown sugar and lemon zest in place of vinegar, and the ingredients hit all the right spots: hot, salty, and a little sweet. Chile fanatics will be happy to munch on these just as they are, but the jalapeños and their liquid also make a terrific accompaniment to the first course of <epi:recieplink id=""3510910"">shrimp and scallion pancakes.</epi:recieplink>"
5017621~Creamy Forest Mushroom Soup~5056~835~9~164~110~32204~314~Highly recommended!
5017622~Skillet-Toasted Quinoa~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~Skillet-toasting quinoa will add texture and flavor to a dish. I recommend using a nonstick skillet for this. If you use a standard skillet, the quinoa requires more attention and the skillet needs occasional scraping. The goal is for the quinoa to retain its tenderness but acquire a toasted exterior. You can cook the quinoa more or less, according to your taste preferences.
5017623~Chocolate-Glazed Chocolate Pear Torte~4735~449~284~51~310~1100~1015~This dense, moist chocolate cake, made with dried pears, is stunning when decorated with gold leaf. Of course, you can always simply top it with chocolate curls.

(Ask the market to cut the lobster tails and crab legs in half lengthwise for you.) A selection of sauces adds to the party fun.
5017635~Mustard-Seed-Crusted Prime Rib Roast with Roasted Balsamic Onions~2440~181~95~45~169~33377~403~For some, Christmas dinner wouldn't be complete without beef. Here, a decadent prime rib roast is coated in mustard seeds and served with a tangy mustard sauce and sweet-sour onions. Serve with steamed baby carrots.

5017639~Damson Tartlets~4833~1069~794~130~101~799~344~This pastry recipe was one of those rare revelations that send shock waves through our test kitchens: How utterly brilliant to make extra dough, freeze it, and then just grate it directly into the pans when you need it! Rowe makes these adorable little tarts with damson plums, but we've found that prune plums work just as well. Although the pastry and compote make enough for twice this many tarts, they keep beautifully and they are so good you will be glad to have extra on hand.
5017640~Bacon and Blue Cheese Salad with Caesar Dressing~3780~302~7~135~227~7782~380~A delicious blend of classic flavors.

5017665~Wild Blueberry Pie with Almond Crumble Topping~6209~1296~37~241~17~7242~0~Wild blueberries are small and flavorful. They can be found fresh at farmers' markets and frozen at supermarkets and specialty foods stores. The little bit of almond in the topping amps up the flavor of the berries.

5017668~Cumin Seed Roasted Cauliflower with Salted Yogurt, Mint, and Pomegranate Seeds~265~4~2~1~27~993~0~When the nights turn blustery and the temperature drops, I know that roasted vegetable season has arrived, and I embrace it with reckless abandon. I'll roast any kind of sturdy vegetable that I can cut up and fit into my oven, but one of my favorites is cauliflower, preferably tossed with whole cumin seeds. Not only does the cumin act as a natural remedy to help reduce the dreaded intestinal gas factor (or so I've been told), but it also adds a pleasant earthy flavor to balance the assertive tang of the vegetable.
5017669~Peach Soup~1744~303~265~0~0~37~0~Highly recommended!
5017670~Pineapple-Coconut Napoleons with Mascarpone Cream and Pineapple Syrup~5684~772~696~39~249~955~835~The coconut tuiles (cookies) that go into this layered dessert (left) are delicate, so the recipe provides for quite a few extras to allow for breakage. Tuiles are also terrific with ice cream. The syrup gets an interesting (and delicious) kick from nontraditional dessert ingredients like black peppercorns and a jalapeño chili.
5017671~Charred Corn Husk Oil Dressing~2341~46~35~13~242~247~0~Corn husks can be transformed into a surprisingly flavorful oil. At Seäsonal, this vinaigrette is tossed with Bibb lettuce, radishes, and crisp pumpernickel croutons.

5017676~Grilled Sweetbreads~236~0~0~0~27~11632~0~Grilling sweetbreads gives them a crispy crust that contrasts beautifully with their creamy, tender interior. In Argentina, sweetbreads are usually grilled whole, but we find people are less intimidated by them when they're prepared this way — separated into pieces. As with all offal, be sure the sweetbreads are very fresh.

When preparing this recipe, Dickinson uses the leftover poaching liquid to make rice.

5017693~New England Sausage Stuffing with Maple Corn Bread~1601~146~32~16~102~2431~623~Maple syrup in the corn bread adds a touch of New England to this traditional stuffing. The leftover bread is also nice with scrambled eggs or omelets.
5017694~Barley-Stuffed Peppers~2983~327~16~159~120~6917~245~This is an almost perfect dish for the home cook because it's economical, healthy, and scrumptious! You can whip it up anytime you have leftover cooked barley, brown rice, or quinoa from the night before. You could even reinvigorate a container of rice from last night's Chinese or Indian takeout! For a carnivore's take on this dish, add a cup of browned ground meat in place of 1 cup of the cooked barley or other grain.
5017695~Dirty Fried Rice~1845~105~20~69~122~4049~1010~Watson, who's from Louisiana, grew up on his mom's dirty rice; that dish helped inspire this bastardized fried version. The chicken-liver base tastes very concentrated and intense on its own, but becomes nicely balanced in the finished dish.

Their favorite pasta shape - and the symbol of the region - is arecchiette, or ""little ears"". Called recchie or recchietelle in the local dialect, orecchiette is eaten just about daily, but is prepared a different way in almost every village. The sauces for this whimsical pasta are straightforward and usually contain vegetables, beans or legumes. This recipe is one of the most basic."

5017714~Salmon Papillotes with Fennel, Potatoes, and Olives~942~48~6~1~78~1653~0~It appears on your plate wrapped up like a present. But there's more to this dish than pretty presentation. When you bake salmon, potatoes, and fresh herb-sprinkled vegetables in parchment paper, something magical happens. Nestled in the package, the ingredients cook in their own juices. And when you snip the papillote open, dinner reveals itself in a cloud of aromatic steam.
5017715~Chicken with Ginger-Cilantro Pesto~1053~10~5~21~103~688~45~Like a traditional basil pesto, this sauce can also be mixed with pasta, stirred into soup for a lively accent or spread over grilled fish.

This stick-to-your-ribs breakfast for a crowd can be completely assembled the night before."
5017721~Skillet Corn Cake With Stewed Cherries~3705~607~427~73~148~2428~437~To make the best use of your time, prepare the deceptively delicious cherry sauce while the corn cake is baking. The cake is best served either warm or at room temperature, with the stewed cherries spooned over the top.

What to drink: A light- to medium-bodied red wine with dark fruit flavors is just the thing. Try the Giacosa 2005 Dolcetto d'Alba (Italy, $20) or the Campo Viejo 2000 Reserva (Spain, $13).
5017750~Chicken and Root Vegetable Stew~2165~217~63~36~97~7789~324~Make this almost entirely ahead (up to two days), and simply reheat before serving. Crusty bread and a salad round out the main course. Serve Sauvignon Blanc alongside.

5017758~Steamed Whole Fish with Ginger, Scallions, and Soy~1812~75~37~40~161~3928~102~This is a simple way to prepare whole fish, yet one that few Western cooks have mastered. In the Vietnamese culture, a properly steamed fish is a benchmark for chefs, and those who can't do it right are considered to be bad cooks. A perfectly steamed fish has flesh that is just cooked at the bone, never dry. Typically, whole fish are not served with the liquid in which it was steamed, which is too fishy tasting, and any sauce is added at the end, after the fish has been cooked. In this classic Chinese preparation, the fish is topped with scallions, cilantro and ginger, then doused with hot oil, which releases the flavor of the aromatics into the flesh of the fish.
5017759~Orange Rum Rickey~139~30~1~2~0~588~0~Highly recommended!
5017760~Grilled Salmon with Basil and Mint~1192~175~54~15~37~1131~46~We prefer wild salmon for this recipe because it has a milder flavor and is more environmentally friendly than farmed varieties.

Sour orange lends a uniquely Caribbean flair. We like to brighten our sancocho by pairing it with avocado, rice, and cilantro, and to inject a little heat with a splash of hot sauce. We would not turn down an accompanying plate of crunchy tostones (twice-fried green plantains).
5017762~Mexican Chocolate and Almond Cake~2341~284~244~30~122~725~633~A fitting finale to a Mexican-style meal. Leftover cake is great for breakfast or an afternoon snack.

5017816~Orange Aperol Sun~687~131~126~19~8~985~72~This Italian spin on the Mimosa gets its unique flavor from Aperol, a bright-orange Italian liqueur made from bitter oranges, rhubarb, and herbs. Its similar to Campari, but less bitter and more floral. In Italy, Aperol is served on the rocks mixed with Prosecco and a splash of club soda. In this recipe, the club soda has been replaced with a little fresh orange juice.

This nation of more than a billion people has more vegetarians than there are people in the United States. Over the centuries, Indian grill masters have evolved a highly sophisticated style of vegetarian barbecue—dishes bursting with flavor (not to mention dairy and grain proteins). It's grilling so complex and satisfying, you'll never miss the meat. Tandoori aloo (potato) turns up at grill parlors throughout northern India.

5017834~Chicken Breasts with Chive and Mustard Sauce~756~5~2~0~70~1859~220~One of my favorite classic bistro dishes is steak Diane, a paragon of quick cooking that finds steak swathed in a cream sauce mightily seasoned with mustard and enhanced with cognac. The next time you feel yourself feeling those bistro pangs, try my take on steak Diane, made with chicken instead of beef, and my version of the traditional sauce with shallots and mustard. Roasted garlic mashed potatoes is a perfect accompaniment; the potatoes will soak up the sauce. Or serve it with fries and an ice-cold Belgian beer.

5017878~Roasted Baby Beets and Arugula Salad with Lemon Gorgonzola Vinaigrette~716~62~18~32~29~1937~126~Try a milder domestic Gorgonzola (rather than the equally delicious but more pungent Italian version). Using an assortment of different colored beets makes the salad more vibrant.

5017912~Tri-Tip Roast with Sun-Dried Tomato and Roasted-Pepper Relish~975~115~16~20~36~3704~0~Tri-tip is flavorful and well-marbled, but because its really a roast rather than a steak, salt and seasonings dont affect it the same way they do a thinner cut. Thats where this Mediterranean-inspired relish comes in. The combination of roasted red pepper, sun-dried tomatoes, and capers adds savor to every bite.
5017913~Borracho Beans~1255~128~22~64~50~5364~127~Borracho means drunk, and it refers to the beer in the cooking liquid. If you're cooking beans and pork roast at the same time, you can use the fatty pieces of pork that you remove while carving to add flavor to the beans. Otherwise, use some bacon.

5017966~Southwest Chicken Salad with Rice, Corn, and Chilies~3226~397~14~53~166~3065~45~If you're short on time, use a roast chicken from the supermarket instead of grilling chicken breasts. Serve Mexican beers alongside and tortilla chips for extra crunch.

5017970~Spiced Pear Upside-Down Cake~5992~632~452~110~405~2600~433~"Make sure the cake pan you're using is at least 2"" deep; the batter will rise to the very top while baking and will overflow in a shallow pan."

5017972~Ramen with Smoked Turkey Broth~2801~399~39~125~61~8477~678~Check your authenticity meter at the door: This is the speediest, least traditional—and most fun—ramen ever invented.

5017979~Raspberry Orange Margaritas~935~231~202~5~0~30~0~Highly recommended!
5017982~"Medicine Lodge Filet Mignon ""Fricassée"""~21~4~0~0~0~347~0~Filet mignon, the tenderloin cut, is one of the leanest cuts of meat. Executive chef Chad Luethje makes this steak house favorite even healthier by trimming the fat to 1D8 of an inch and substituting cooking spray for butter in the pan.
5017983~Rhubarb Raspberry Meringue Cake~2726~675~619~13~0~195~4~This cake should not be assembled until just before serving.
5017985~Spicy Stir-Fried Brown Rice with Broccolini and Scallops~2612~412~19~129~48~4124~126~Broccolini is a hybrid of broccoli and Chinese kale. You'll need to cook and cool the rice before you begin.

5017993~Peach Prosecco~74~4~4~4~3~231~21~Sean Traynor, bartender at The Windsor in Phoenix, Arizona, created this crisp, beautifully hued cocktail for our story Spring Cocktails Perfect for Brunch. Sparkling wine is often used to top off a drink, but in this case Traynor mixes it with the rest of the ingredients in the cocktail shaker. The reason? He's using it more for its acidity and flavor than effervescence. For pure peach flavor, Traynor insists on a true peach-based liqueur, so put away the peach Schnapps; he recommends Sathenay Crème de Pêche de Vigne Liqueur, Rothman & Winter Orchard Peach Liqueur, or Massenez Crème de Pêche.
5017995~Fruit Salad with Fennel, Watercress, and Smoked Salt~1388~222~175~3~55~1427~0~Feel free to adapt this fruit salad as the seasons change; aim for a mix of juicy fruit (like melon), stone fruit, and berries.

5017997~Classic Lemon Cheesecake~4764~250~87~114~387~2799~1245~You can't beat the classics when it comes to desserts, and this is one of my best. Zesty, creamy and light-as-air, this cake is completely heavenly. It's impossible to stop at one slice!

5018000~Miso Carbonara with Broccoli Rabe and Red-Pepper Flakes~5111~417~17~241~264~10091~664~"The warm spaghetti in this dish ""cooks"" the egg mixture to create a silky sauce, just like in a traditional carbonara recipe. Miso paste increases the umami factor and bright broccoli rabe brings freshness to the classic bacon, egg, and cheese combo."
5018001~Shiitake, Beef, and Barley Soup~1279~251~38~18~14~2375~0~Highly recommended!
5018002~Pork Tonkatsu with Watermelon-Tomato Salad~4075~427~93~111~219~193823~424~Pound the pork into superthin cutlets to get the best crust-to-meat ratio. Make extra for a next-day sandwich.
5018003~Orange-Scented Chocolate Almond Cake Kirkgaard~4050~327~175~92~285~1970~649~A small slice of this delightfully dense chocolate cake goes a long way.
5018004~Lamb Chops and Spinach and Turnip Purée~4923~460~338~255~244~9094~1076~The lamb roasts on a bed of thyme to infuse the meat.
5018005~Chocolate-Bourbon Tart with Currants and Orange Custard Sauce~3153~278~224~50~204~1719~606~This tart will satisfy any chocolate lover. To make the chocolate curls, briefly microwave a 12-ounce block of bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened) until it's just slightly softened. Pull the blade of a heavy large knife across the surface to form curls.
5018007~Peanut Butter, Chocolate and Banana FroYo~1032~176~67~10~36~42~3~Highly recommended!

5018011~Chocolate Hazelnut Crinkle Cookies~3979~853~560~138~94~2729~591~These classic rich, chewy cookies crack — or, yes, crinkle — as they bake. Hazelnuts, cocoa, and chocolate come together to make them particularly potent.
5018013~"""Carbonnade à la Flamande"" Short Ribs"~2116~278~176~399~276~33667~1357~Carbonnade is the quintessential Belgian comfort food; this recipes caramelized onions, brown sugar, and brown beer make the sweet stew addictive. Chef Palombino also recommends making this carbonnade with any muscular cut of beef that's good for stewing, such as skirt and hanger steaks.
5018014~Lefse~841~139~0~56~46~988~141~Like a potato-y flatbread and great topped with cured fish.

5018016~Tomatillo-Avocado Salsa with Tortilla Chips~834~66~20~4~57~2227~0~The tangy tomatillos are balanced by rich, buttery avocados. Serve with your favorite tortilla chips—and Margaritas.
5018100~Cabernet-Cranberry Sauce with Figs~1085~285~255~5~0~48~0~Who knew Cabernet and cranberries would make such a dynamic duo? Add dried figs (plumped in the Cabernet ahead of time), and you end up with a winey, fruity fig bar, minus the cookie. This sauce is so fine, you'll be spooning leftovers on ice cream or slathering it on toast in place of jam. It's worth buying extra cranberries and freezing them so you can make more to last you through the winter.
5018020~Eggplant Tartines with Hummus and Arugula~1999~170~17~49~121~8266~0~Highly recommended!

5018024~Winter Pudding~3536~787~612~19~19~1170~0~This chilled dessert is a variation on summer pudding, that quintessential English sweet made with soft fruits such as raspberries and blackberries.
5018025~Butternut Squash with Pumpkin-Seed Pesto~476~0~0~0~55~0~0~Here's an idea: Save a few of the toasted pumpkin seeds to use as a garnish. That little bit of extra crunch will complement the sweet, succulent squash beautifully.
5018026~Gouda and Red Salad Pizza~2642~40~11~159~203~6568~632~Highly recommended!
5018027~Mâche, Parmesan, Pear, and Walnut Salad~1703~88~41~78~114~2195~194~A lovely twist on the traditional pear and blue cheese pairing. Tender lamb's lettuce and toasted walnuts provide great contrasting textures. Use a vegetable peeler to make thin shavings of Parmesan.
5018028~Grilled, Korean-Style Steaks with Spicy Cilantro Sauce~261~53~51~0~6~744~0~Active time: 30 min Start to finish: 1 1/2 hr
5018030~Roast Rack of Lamb with Mint Sauce~3302~673~103~79~9~10783~9~The lamb that we buy today hardly requires a typical English mint sauce (the puckery flavor was originally designed to cut through the stronger taste of mutton), but the combination is by now a traditional and still-welcome one. Buttered carrots and a watercress salad would complement the lamb nicely. Uncork a full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon or red Bordeaux.
5018031~Pork Cassoulet with Pork Confit and Winter Tomato Sauce~3962~592~65~100~88~12769~0~"This traditional recipe calls for pork confit, which you'll need to prepare at least two weeks before making the cassoulet. The confit adds undeniable richness and authenticity, but a simpler recipe (using country-style spareribs instead) appears in ""Top Trends: The Hot Ten"" in the January 2006 issue of Bon Appétit."
5018032~Almond-Plum Buckle~5308~662~229~87~259~1518~876~Buckles are aptly named: Fruit is baked along with a layer of cake batter that rises to the top, buckling as it cooks.
5018033~Osso Buco Milanese~1170~94~59~17~68~7298~47~In Milan, osso buco is traditionally served on a bed of creamy saffron risotto and topped with a pungent, colorful topping of garlic, lemon zest, parsley, and anchovies known as gremolata.

5018043~Scandinavian Shrimp Salad with Dill and Cornichons~655~20~17~104~16~2888~920~For a more substantial meal, the salad can be served on pumpernickel bread or toasted French bread as an open-face sandwich and topped with slices of hard-boiled egg. Garnish with lemon wedges and dill sprigs.
5018044~Caramelized Figs with Raspberry Coulis and Yogurt~177~34~24~4~2~43~4~Highly recommended!
5018045~Perfect No-Cook Strawberry Ice Cream~2404~215~202~3~189~156~629~And how. Cooked eggy custards have their place in the ice cream firmament, but in this instance there is nothing that stands in the way of the juicy, ripe immediacy of a much-loved summer fruit.
5018046~Roasted Red Pepper Soup with Orange Cream~481~60~54~2~22~1522~39~A fantastic way to use jarred peppers.
5018047~Summer Smoothie~2179~556~270~32~7~764~42~Another breakfast option: Whip up a smoothie with other fruits.
5018048~Pan-Roasted Sizzling Shrimp~767~69~8~31~39~2956~194~Improv: Replace the shrimp with sea scallops and use only poblano chiles.

5018055~Fried Chinese Five-Spice Chicken Wings~15717~256~61~215~1634~18210~844~The two-pronged cooking method used for these wings —incorporating both braising and deep-frying — is a takeoff on the Chinese technique of steaming, then frying. We think it keeps the meat unbelievably tender while getting the skin supercrispy. Be sure to allow 2 hours for the wings to marinate.
5018056~Chocolate Orange Crème Brûlée~2848~239~218~38~207~1182~629~Highly recommended!
5018057~Smoked Scotch Eggs~1329~10~5~93~101~4402~615~"Sausage-wrapped ""Scotch"" eggs are a tasty and interesting dish when breaded and fried in the traditional manner, but cooking them on the smoker makes a very special treat. The homemade sausage gets a nice crust on the outside and, if you get it cooked just right, the egg yolk will have a little bit of ooze on the inside. Just make sure to seal the sausage all the way around the egg before smoking. I like to serve these as an appetizer, but they are also fine as a nice smoked addition to a lunch salad."
5018060~Pesto Oil~1192~33~0~0~110~985~0~Highly recommended!
5018061~Roast Squabs with Porcini and Country Bread Salad~1356~111~1~7~89~6193~94~Active time: 1 3/4 hr Start to finish: 2 3/4 hr
5018062~Chicken and Vegetable Pot Pies with Cream Cheese Crust~4489~599~84~104~170~4559~364~This filling is definitely not peas and hard carrots and tough chunks of chicken. Instead, there are sun-dried tomatoes and shiitake mushrooms with flavorful pieces of thyme-seasoned chicken.
5018063~Grilled Halibut Niçoise With Market Vegetables~3020~159~43~185~225~9941~608~If it looks good at the market, it will be good in this salad.
5018064~Brussel Leaf and Baby Spinach Sauté~1423~107~26~64~91~1370~0~"If you are the cook around the house, you know how sweet the words ""I love this. Please make it again!"" sound. This side has become my go-to dish for something quick and pretty, as I love the juxtaposition of the two shades of green. After you remove the leaves from the brussels sprouts, this takes only minutes to prepare. Brussels sprouts are miniature balls of cabbage, so their stems can be pretty tough. By working from the outermost leaf inward, and cutting more of the stem whenever necessary, you follow the pattern of the sprout to easily remove its leaves. You can do this part in advance, but you'll want to sauté them just before serving."
5018065~Minted Spring Vegetables~1075~76~24~5~82~1732~0~Because this dish was developed to complement the strong flavors of Pork Loin with Morel Stuffing, we kept the seasoning in these vegetables to a minimum. If you plan to serve this dish with simpler fare, you might want to increase the amount of garlic and herbs.
5018066~Niçoise Tuna Salad Wrap~1042~116~15~48~47~44243~427~Highly recommended!
5018067~Polenta with Bacon and Sage~2486~35~2~123~201~5965~547~Highly recommended!
5018068~Trout with Cucumber and Sour Cream~695~22~14~10~63~1040~80~A delicate and sophisticated main course. Look for trout fillets with skin or have the fishmonger fillet two whole trout for you.
5018069~Cavatappi with Butternut Squash~2814~458~34~82~70~1329~143~Highly recommended!
5018070~Bean & 'Bello Burger~1938~298~75~68~62~3723~5~Highly recommended!
5018071~Orange and Endive Salad with Maple Chipotle Vinaigrette~489~60~53~0~27~1038~0~It's impossible to overstate just how well the ingredients come together in this beautiful salad. The textural contrast of juicy ripe oranges and crisp endives is enhanced by a surprisingly complex vinaigrette containing sweet, spicy, and smoky flavors.
5018074~Pickled Sweet and Sour Red Cabbage~435~111~105~0~3~40297~0~This is a lovely crunchy and tangy accompaniment to cold meats and salads. Store any leftovers in the refrigerator and use within a few days.

5018077~Grilled Steak Panzanella Salad With Tomato Vinaigrette~964~168~56~21~15~5709~44~Ripe, juicy tomatoes provide the salad dressing as well as a key ingredient in this hanger steak salad. With balsamic, garlic, and plenty of fresh basil, it will transport you to the sunny Italian countryside.
5018078~Quinoa with Mango and Curried Yogurt~1149~46~7~39~94~3660~0~Highly recommended!
5018079~Pumpkin Cheesecake with Marshmallow-Sour Cream Topping and Gingersnap Crust~4654~700~642~40~201~1631~503~Forget marshmallows with the yams this year. Instead, use them to make the topping for this cheesecake. Because the cheesecake needs to chill overnight, be sure to begin one day ahead.
5018080~Grilled Halibut with Lemongrass Tomato Sauce~733~55~14~20~42~1533~35~If you prefer to present these halibut steaks with additional grill marks (as in the photo), you can grill the skin sides for about 1 minute each before grilling flesh.
5018082~Curried Chicken, Green Bean and Almond Salad~606~33~12~9~47~726~47~The almonds and crisp green beans lend good crunch. For a light lunch, serve this with French bread and a fruit salad.
5018083~Creamed Oysters on Toasted Corn Bread~1337~90~13~17~103~759~299~Highly recommended!
5018084~Grilled New Orleans-Style Shrimp~1218~37~1~21~106~2072~408~Serve these spicy grilled shrimp with bread for sopping up all the sauce.
5018086~Ricotta Gnudi with Wild Mushroom and Truffle Sauce~3926~224~33~153~258~9702~672~Psilakis uses fresh sheep's milk ricotta, but fresh cow's milk ricotta works, too.
5018087~Sherry-Soaked Almond Cake with Mixed Berries~5031~323~90~125~360~2212~1182~Highly recommended!
5018088~Blueberry and Cinnamon Breakfast Oaty Muffins~541~93~86~14~10~150~370~"I have lots of people asking me to create gluten-free recipes that do not just rely on the gluten-free flour that can be found in the shops. I have experimented with almond flour (ground almonds), but find that the resulting bakes can be quite heavy, which does not suit all baked goods, and also highly calorific. So while I use ground almonds in some things, I do like to use oats in others. The cinnamon in this recipe adds a lovely taste to the blueberries,
as well as helping regulate blood sugar levels."
5018089~Radish Yogurt With Pine Nuts~690~42~26~14~51~375~11~Salting the radishes keeps them crunchy, and keeps the yogurt dip from turning pink.

5018091~Grilled Pineapple with Butter-Rum Glaze and Vanilla Mascarpone~2908~279~234~12~199~672~473~Editor's Note: This recipe was originally part of a menu by Bobby Flay for a backyard barbecue. For the complete menu and Flay's tips on throwing a party, click here.
5018092~Semolina Gnocchi with Oxtail Ragù~7580~401~141~378~493~47615~1154~Until quite recently, Italian restaurants in the U.S. served just one version of gnocchi: the potato kind. But gnocchi made from semolina (such as this one from the James Beard Award-nominated, industrial-chic Osteria in Philadelphia) is equally authentic.
5018093~Pot-Au-Feu~4110~392~114~305~1211~52475~2045~This hands-on French feast of vegetables and cuts of meat boiled in a savory broth is traditionally served in courses. It begins with the bone marrow on toast, then follows with the broth and the meats and vegetables. Feel free to serve it all at once, providing plenty of toasted bread and savory condiments for dipping.
5018094~Blood Orange and Mixed Bean Salad With Sprouts~994~85~20~28~56~1801~0~Beans can roll with virtually any flavor profile, including bright fresh citrus, lime juice, and chiles in this wintery salad.
5018095~Spicy Corn Chowder~1195~117~35~25~66~3014~154~Highly recommended!
5018098~Bistro Steak with Buttermilk Onion Rings~2215~280~124~93~68~1634~63~Here's how to time this: Have the salad and onion ring components ready before you cook the steak and the sauce, then keep the sauce warm while you fry the onions. Toss the salad at the last moment.
5018099~Coconut-Lime Bars with Hazelnut Shortbread Crust~4159~379~75~72~255~624~781~A sprinkling of sweetened coconut tempers the tangy lime filling.
5018101~Orange-Ginger Charoset~1389~96~64~42~97~659~0~Although major brands of crystallized ginger list only sugar and ginger in the ingredients, crystallized ginger cannot be purchased with kosher-for-Passover certification. If you choose to omit this ingredient, increase the fresh ginger by one teaspoon and add 2 extra teaspoons of honey. This recipe is best served within a few hours of preparation.
5018102~Lemon Pine Nut Tagliatelle~2165~36~13~16~230~920~0~"""This is one of my favorite pastas,"" Lisa Bonacossi said, citing its simplicity. ""it is made with lemons, pine nuts, and oil that everyone has on hand."" The flavors are simple and brilliant. The sauce is best served with fresh tagliatelle.

5018265~Breaded Chicken Cutlets (aka Grandma Jody's Chicken)~1714~339~17~98~13~1226~419~"In spite of my desire to never eat breaded chicken cutlets again, this was the first meal I ever made for Andy (at twenty-two, my meal repertoire was about as varied as my dad's) and in the years since, the chicken has proven to be a real lifesaver in the slap-it-together weeknight meal department. Plus, if you have this in your repertoire, you can make ""chicken pizza,"" chicken Milanese (just top with an arugula and tomato salad that has been tossed with oil and vinegar), and real chicken fingers."

5018273~Cardamom Yogurt Pudding with Orange and Cinnamon Honey Syrup~278~52~48~7~4~86~15~Ground cardamom is worth seeking out for this recipe — it adds another dimension to the dessert. The spice can be found at many supermarkets, Middle Eastern and Indian markets, and specialty foods shops.

5018286~Salmon Cannelloni with Lemon Cream Sauce~1500~74~6~60~122~2741~734~Wrapping salmon fillets in crespelle (crêpelike pasta) infused with fresh tarragon brings a mild herbal flavor to the fish and keeps the fillets moist. A lemon sauce adds another layer of sophistication.

5018291~Pineapple-Caramel Flan~1566~397~381~9~0~195~4~This unique flan — made with pineapple juice rather than milk or cream — comes from Patria in New York. Use the pineapple juice found near the orange juice in supermarket refrigerator sections, and begin making the flan a day ahead.

The smoked paprika that flavors the chorizo may be far from traditional, but it adds another layer of depth to this seductive stir-fry of rice noodles with shrimp, egg, and jicama. There's just enough chile paste for a mild buzz of heat, but not so much that your mouth is on fire.

5018303~Mediterranean Chickpea Latkes~1474~67~1~16~119~3083~370~Chickpea fritters laced with rosemary are common in parts of France and Italy. For a terrific side dish that serves eight, top these latkes with a quick sauce made by stirring two tablespoons dried mint into one cup plain yogurt, and offer with fish. Or drizzle the latkes with pomegranate molasses (found at Middle Eastern markets and some supermarkets), and serve with meat or poultry.

5018306~Soft-Shell Crabs with Wilted Spinach and Warm Tomato-Basil Vinaigrette~849~61~42~17~56~581~91~"When Roy Yamaguchi invited me to cook at the 5th Anniversary celebration of his Oahu restaurant, I wanted to bring him something special from my neck of the woods and decided to attempt to transport soft-shelled crabs. I say ""attempt"" because soft-shells are very delicate and I wasn't sure they'd survive the long trip to Hawaii. Happily, of the 10 dozen live ones we packed up, about 8 dozen were still kicking when we got to our destination. I served them with simple accompaniments like wilted spinach and a crushed summer tomato vinaigrette."
5018307~Curried Pumpkin Breads~3473~465~62~124~118~7634~584~Highly recommended!
5018308~Grilled Tandoori-Style Chicken and Mangoes with Mango Jasmine Rice~3872~465~39~56~201~5984~30~Mangoes are used two ways in this Indian dish — grilled with the chicken and tossed into rice.
5018309~Pea Pesto~304~47~26~17~0~3103~9~Pea pesto is a condiment, a sauce, a flavor enhancer. I spread it on grilled skirt steak marinated in horseradish and on lamb chops. I sauce spaghettini with pea pesto (just boil the pasta in chicken stock and toss in the pea pesto and garnish with toasted breadcrumbs) and I dress cold roast chicken with pea pesto and homemade yogurt. I broil or grill seafood skewers and serve them on a pillow of pea pesto; I sauté scallops or swordfish in the pan with pea pesto; and serve poached eggs on an English muffin spread with pea pesto. For extra zing, you can add a tablespoon of horseradish to every cup of peas.
5018310~Maple-Glazed Sour Cream Doughnuts with Sugared-Walnut Streusel~9252~1483~829~160~297~4867~472~The tender texture of these cake doughnuts comes from folding in the dry ingredients gently by hand, rather than beating them in with a mixer.
5018311~Ciabatta Pizza with Gorgonzola, Walnut Pesto, and Pears~7361~242~108~195~630~5441~398~The pears give this pretty pizza fresh flavor and texture.

5018314~Passion Fruit Mousses with Raspberry Swirl~900~215~202~12~0~70~0~Highly recommended!
5018316~Italian Kale Caesar Salad~1711~1~0~73~157~6867~176~You'll make more dressing than you need for one batch of salad with this recipe, but that's a good thing—you'll want to keep using it on all your salads all week.
5018317~Cranberry and Dried-Cherry Relish~1715~437~401~0~0~59~0~So good — and no cooking required. Prepare the relish at least a day ahead, and add more cardamom before serving if you'd like a stronger flavor.
5018318~Fruited Chili Sauce~6119~1527~1436~3~0~12727~0~Highly recommended!
5018319~"""Candy Corn"" Frozen Citrus Cream Pops"~1019~41~37~3~98~245~326~Candy corn may be synonymous with Halloween, but come on, how many of us really love the chewy little tooth-shaped candies with a flavor that is indistinguishable beyond sweet? However, if you borrow their iconic shape and colors and transform those into creamy lemon-and-orange frozen pops, we predict everyone will be clamoring for their fair share.
5018320~Braised Baby Artichokes and Shallots~1257~177~26~45~38~2474~31~Baby artichokes are much easier to prepare than the large ones, as they can be eaten choke and all. For ease of serving, these vegetables may be tossed with the roasted potatoes (see Green Olive, Lemon and Garlic-Roasted Leg of Lamb with Potatoes and Pan Gravy ) for a delicious all-in-one side dish.
5018321~Wildflower-Honey Semifreddo with Honey Sesame Wafers~2748~275~210~42~185~469~535~This sophisticated dessert makes the most of contrasting textures. The subtle floral flavor of wildflower honey connects all of the components.

5019601~Herbed Olive Oil~4101~421~274~2~279~1042~5~Parsley, mint, and lemon zest make this herbed oil a versatile condiment for a number of dishes. If you are following our $50 dinner party menu, use it for the rice , the soup , and the dip.

5018331~Pan-Seared Salmon Over Red Cabbage and Onions with Merlot Gastrique~788~88~59~41~30~15254~84~If you are using a single 12-inch nonstick skillet for this recipe, make the red cabbage and onions first. Transfer to a heated serving bowl and cover to keep warm, then clean skillet and cook salmon.
5018332~Oatmeal Cookies with Dried Cherries~2426~489~131~89~29~728~4~That's right, schmaltz oatmeal cookies. We had to have something sweet! The schmaltz does have a great effect here—it doesn't make the cookie taste like chicken, but it does give it a savory depth to balance the sweetness. So using schmaltz in a cookie turns out to be a fascinating and useful example of balancing sweet with a savory ingredient. I love the tart, dense dried cherries in these cookies, but this recipe is a great all-purpose vehicle for whatever garnish you want to give them—raisins, dried cranberries, walnuts, pecans or a mixture of any or all of the above.
5018333~Apple Pandowdy~4669~545~394~48~267~2013~794~This apple pandowdy recipe is so delicious that we're just going to have to say: Cobbler, you’ve been warned.
5018334~Blue Cheese with Rosemary Honey on Crackers~1227~286~186~7~17~592~31~With a little planning, this addictive treat can be easily thrown together at the last minute. Infuse the honey up to 24 hours in advance and arrange the blue cheese on crackers several hours ahead of time. Then, just before serving, drizzle with honey and sprinkle with scallions.
5018335~Ginger & Hoisin Duck with Glass Noodles~174~29~17~5~3~670~10~Head to a local Chinese supermarket for the ginger in syrup and, while you're there, pick up a package of glass or cellophane noodles to serve this with. Tangy ginger and flavorful hoisin work so well with duck. Make sure you render the duck breasts well when cooking to get that ultimate crispy skin.

5018337~Autumn Gin Sour~318~68~56~9~0~238~4~Egg whites are shaken into this gin-based sour, where they take on an airy, velvety texture.
5018338~White Chocolate Tiramisu Trifle With Spiced Pears~5816~641~567~23~367~1624~1224~To show off the layers, use a 12-cup trifle dish, a footed glass bowl measuring about 8 inches across and 5 inches deep.
5018339~Thyme-Roasted Chicken Breast with Morel-Madeira Gravy~593~82~12~27~22~3403~45~For a hearty meal, just add some garlic mashed potatoes to go with the chicken. The recipe doubles easily.

5018350~Slow-Roasted Pork with Lime Mojo~134~1~0~17~6~652~58~The Lime Mojo (a sauce of olive oil, chilies, garlic and spices) provides a spicy, tangy counterpoint to the pork. Serve the Spiced Butternut Squash and the Corn and Cheese Arepas (see recipes) as side dishes, and pour a Zinfandel or dark beer. Begin preparing the pork a day ahead.
5018351~Lemon-Spice Bread Pudding with Sauteed Peaches~6404~1059~346~140~175~10975~898~"Garcia likes making this bread pudding because ""we buy wonderful rustic Italian loaves for the restaurant that are just too good to waste,"" she says."
5018352~Crown of Shrimp with Truffle Sauce~2198~102~24~22~181~2061~0~Though the truffles lend a wonderfully rich flavor to the shrimp, they are fairly costly, so you might want to save this dish for special occasions.
5018353~Chicken Tamales with Tomatillo-Cilantro Sauce~3155~528~14~129~55~11342~222~"Editor's note: In addition to the Mexican crema , Castro also recommends serving these tamales with Creamy Salsa Verde and Chipotle Chile Sauce
While tamales are one of Mexico's most famous street foods, they are also one of its most popular party foods, which is fitting since a tamal is packaged like a small gift waiting to be unwrapped. The many steps involved in tamal making have discouraged countless cooks. But they should not, because the process is very easy. And if you gather a few friends to help with the assembling, you can have a tamal-making party before the real party begins."
5018355~Spiced Black Bean Burgers~246~44~6~7~4~442~0~Make a salad of rice tossed with diced jicama, red bell pepper, avocado and a vinaigrette dressing, and pass bowls of sour cream and shredded lettuce to accompany these Southwest-style meatless bean burgers. A lemon tart is a perfect finale.

5018358~Chicken, Shrimp and Sausage Stew~3405~182~58~226~120~7812~1241~This hearty stew was inspired by the flavors of Spain and Portugal. Because it can be made ahead, it's a perfect dish to enjoy after a day of skiing or other winter play. Offer the stew with some crusty bread and a chilled bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. Follow with the curly endive salad. For dessert, serve a seasonal fruit tart from your favorite bakery.

5018362~Coconut Lime Mussels~846~47~6~0~31~3141~0~"This tropical twist on the French classic moules marinières serves up briny mussels in a tangy coconut broth enhanced by ginger and lemongrass. You'll find the pretty green stalks of fresh lemongrass in the produce section of many fine supermarkets and specialty-food shops, alongside the brown knobby fresh ginger rhizomes, or roots. Both aromatics need to be peeled before using, and both have dense, stringy flesh that can be difficult to mince. Grating is a good solution for ginger; include the juices that are extruded when you scrape. For lemongrass, peel and use only the tender midsection of the slender, bulblike stalk. Smash it with the flat side of a chef's knife to make mincing easier.
Increase your dining pleasure by sipping, as an accompaniment, any bright, fresh white wine that offers good acidity. Think sparkling wine, unoaked Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, or Sauvignon Blanc."

5018371~Mussels with Saffron Cream~1355~11~5~0~138~3918~314~Just a small amount of precious saffron turns this weeknight supper into something out of the ordinary. We prefer cultivated mussels because they require less cleaning, making them a cinch to prepare.

5018385~Tarocco Spritz~1077~256~254~8~4~332~40~Inspired by a cocktail from New York City bartender Natasha David, the crimson-colored Tarocco Spritz is a nod to the flavor and color of the Sicilian Tarocco orange, often referred to as the “half-blood orange.” A mixed-heritage cocktail, this drink has a bumped-up base of gin to match the vibrant bitter aperitivo liqueur Cappelletti. The drink’s acidity comes courtesy of blood orange, lemon juice, and prosecco, bound together by the unlikely addition of vanilla, which complements Cappelletti’s notes of spice and oxidation.
5018386~Super Succotash~3869~530~38~100~157~6159~31~The vegetables can be prepared ahead and finished up to the middle of step 3. Heat for 5 minutes before serving.

5018395~Sweet Peach Tea~5440~1876~162~0~30~811~0~Why serve plain iced tea when you can punch it up with healthy, natural flavors like ginger, mint, lemon and peach, as in Bonaparte's version here? A good reason to steep and sip: Tea's polyphenols may lower your risk for cancer.

5018398~Pork Shoulder Al'Diavolo~1478~33~0~28~135~1725~107~Letting the roast sit at room temperature will help it cook more evenly; starting it at a higher temperature jump-starts the browning process.

5018422~Parsnip and Carrot Chips~113~26~11~2~0~2020~0~Choose the largest and broadest carrots and parsnips among those available at the store; smaller, more slender ones won't form large enough strips to be fruitful for frying.

5018442~Tangerine Souffles~2701~275~238~20~159~275~633~What's the secret to a good soufflé? Beating the egg whites with the sugar until they are stiff and still very shiny, then folding them into the flavor base carefully in two or three additions so that the whites do not deflate. This dessert has an intense tangerine flavor, which comes from using the entire fruit, except for its seeds, of course. Any leftover tangerine syrup can be added to sparkling wine to make a mimosa with a twist.

The recipe is not as complicated as it appears at first glance—the different components all come together to make a complete meal in a single dish. The potatoes are stiffer than the average mash because they will be forming the crust for the pie.
5018444~Microwave Chicken Piccata~712~20~6~21~60~3266~136~Juicy chicken cutlets with all the bright, briny flavors of classic piccata are possible without a stove—all you need is a microwave.

5018522~Great One Pot Vegetables~9934~1951~430~309~79~7238~44~I leave the roots on the leeks until after cooking, so they don't fall apart. Just wash and trim beforehand.
5018523~Maple-Soy-Glazed Mackerel Fillets with Avocado~486~97~91~13~9~6792~0~Vinegar, soy, Sherry, and maple syrup create a wonderfully balanced glaze for this mackerel; it takes on a beautiful caramel sheen during cooking.
5018524~Jam Cake with Caramel Chocolate Ganache~6011~742~461~202~285~4115~749~Filled with spices, buttermilk, and jam, this moist cake has been in the baking repertoire of my husband's family for over a century. Although this particular recipe hails from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I found many other recipes for jam cake that originated further south. At first glance, I mistakenly thought the jam was merely a filling between the cake layers but to my happy surprise, the jam is actually an ingredient in the batter, creating a lovely berry hue to the cake and an even better berry taste. This down-home cake traditionally calls for a sweet caramel frosting, but I opted for a decadent caramel chocolate ganache. Make the ganache before you make the cake as it needs about 3 hours to firm up at room temperature (and is so much better when not refrigerated).
5018525~Braised Veal Breast with Potato-and-Onion Stuffing~2289~273~56~35~99~14710~161~While this impressive roast cooks, it slowly transfers flavorful juices to the moist potato-and-onion stuffing tucked inside. Once the breast has been cut from the bone, it yields beautiful slices ideal for drizzling with the lush pan sauce.
5018526~Lemon-Garlic Baked Shrimp~974~36~3~72~59~763~660~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5018527~Pear Spice Cake with Pecan Praline Topping~3705~351~266~32~224~1615~996~Boxed spice cake never tasted so good: Fresh pears, crystallized ginger and a sweet nut topping really perk it up. Serve this warm or at room temperature. The topping will be soft when warm; it will be firmer, like southern praline, when cool.
5018528~Mediterranean Vegetable-Cheese Pie~2271~175~64~82~135~6750~666~The secret to this healthy dish's deceptively rich taste? Cheeses that are loaded with flavor but light on fat. Chef Gonzalo Mendoza further reduces the fat content by lining the pan with thinly sliced potatoes instead of piecrust (which typically contains a lot of butter or lard) for a big fat-calorie savings. The spinach, tomatoes, and onion add nearly 8 grams of fiber to every hearty slice.
5018529~Fettuccine with Shrimp~1984~217~8~151~44~3607~931~This recipe, from nutritionist Karen Fisher at Deerfield Spa, provides ideal amounts of carbs, fat and protein. If you're going to be active, simply add 1/2 cup more pasta.
5018530~Herbed Potato Salad~801~63~44~19~12~3855~0~If you haven't already made the low-fat buttermilk dressing for the buffalo burgers you'll need to allow a little extra time for this recipe.
5018532~Penne with Slow-Roasted Cherry Tomatoes and Goat Cheese~2575~381~49~93~85~4922~119~This dish is best eaten right away. You can make all the parts — except for the pasta — way ahead of time and just throw it together at the last minute. (The slow-roasted tomatoes are also great in other roles — as part of an antipasto in the summertime, as an omelet filling, or as a topping on grilled bread.)
5018534~Veal, Wild Mushrooms, and Red Wine~1777~368~35~434~280~9457~1001~Highly recommended!
5018535~Cauliflower Steaks with Cauliflower Purée~499~31~27~8~36~260~28~"Few ingredients, big payoff: Large ""steaks"" are cut from a head of cauliflower, sautéed until golden, then baked until tender. They're served over a simple puree made from the cauliflower florets. An impressive first course, this can also be a lovely side. Just sear two mahi-mahi fillets in butter and place them alongside the cauliflower."
5018536~Provencal Oven-Roasted Tomato Sauce~4788~914~516~90~45~461~0~Freeze some of this sauce now and treat yourself to a burst of summer one cold, wintry day.
5018537~Peach Lattice Pie With Bourbon Caramel~6091~964~942~23~261~2541~802~Peach lattice is a beautifully classic summer pie. A drizzling of rich, buttery bourbon caramel over each slice heightens the naturally lush sweetness of ripe peaches.
5018538~Steak and Boursin Sandwiches~852~67~3~15~58~2711~114~You may never go back to roast beef sandwiches after trying the bold flavor of steak with creamy, garlicky Boursin.
5018539~Fettuccine with Broccoli Rabe, Tomatoes and Ricotta~2986~270~42~72~176~6387~406~Lots of garlic adds great flavor to this dish. At the restaurant they make it with spinach pappardelle, but fettuccine is a convenient substitution.
5018541~Roasted Beets and Carrots with Cumin Vinaigrette, Chickpea Purée, and Flatbread~119~23~16~1~0~2235~0~Highly recommended!

5018545~Sautéed Greens with Labneh and Pine Nuts~2154~50~7~24~205~2298~169~If you like Greek yogurt, you'll love labneh.
5018546~Scottish Sharp-Cheddar Shortbread~2012~98~0~99~163~2409~492~"•Look for a sharp, white Cheddar that is on the dry side, such as English Wensleydale Farmhouse Truckle or Extra Old Black Diamond Cheddar.
•It's important not to whip air into the dough — simply mix until blended."
5018548~Green Posole with Cod and Cilantro~1407~149~14~61~56~2344~95~The lighter, herbier counterpart to porky posole rojo, this brothy stew was made for crisp autumn nights.
5018549~Poached Salmon with Lemon Mayonnaise~2803~90~12~0~258~6166~253~Start with Belgian endive spears filled with caviar of red salmon, golden whitefish or black lumpfish. Serve with your favorite Champagne or Chardonnay.
5018550~Potato and Kale Cakes with Rouille~4547~633~120~59~190~20139~196~Mashed potatoes take on a new form in this delicious dish. A mixture of mashed potatoes and wilted kale is shaped into patties and pan-fried, then paired with a dressed-up mayo. Serve as a first course or with a salad for a light lunch.
5018825~Broiled Salmon Fillet with Mustard Dill Sauce~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5018552~Triple-Cranberry Sauce~741~179~150~0~0~63~0~"""The Indians and English use them much,"" wrote one visitor to New England in 1663, ""boyling them with Sugar for Sauce to eat with their Meat, and it is a delicate Sauce."" Although there is little evidence that cranberry sauce was served at the first Thanksgiving, it is assumed that Indians brought it to the feast. This tangy version gets its intense flavor and color from a mixture of fresh and dried cranberries, along with frozen cranberry juice cocktail concentrate."
5018554~Roasted Salt-and Spice-Packed Pork Loin~236~0~0~0~27~0~0~Roasting the pork at a low temperature in a spiced salt mixture amps up the flavor of the meat and makes it extra-tender. After cooking the pork, the rack of bones is cut off and used to hold the roast for easy carving.
5018555~Cornmeal Cream Cheese Pancakes with Dried Cranberries and Apricots in Maple Syrup~2472~517~317~60~43~2369~454~We got the idea for these pancakes from The Compound Restaurant in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where hot polenta-mascarpone pancakes were the perfect finale to a delicious dinner. They also make a terrific breakfast.
5018556~Chicken Tagine with Chickpeas and Mint~1722~196~40~62~59~2769~149~This one-pot dish is delicious over couscous. What to drink: Wines with distinctive spice notes, such as Gewürztraminer or Syrah.

5018558~Pan-Grilled Beer-Marinated Hanger Steak~486~47~10~6~27~3490~0~What to drink: Stick with beer — choose a dark, medium-bodied lager with a hint of sweetness, like Shiner Bock from Shiner, Texas ($6 per six-pack).
5018559~Christmas Lane Cake~11611~1520~1041~260~608~6659~1584~Dried cherries and apricots highlight this impressive version of a southern classic.

5018561~Arepas with Pulled Pork and Pickled Onion~4338~148~95~388~238~11638~1365~These hors d'oeuvres should be served warm, so reheat the arepas in batches as platters need replenishing.

5018565~Herbed Lamb, Tomato, and Zucchini Kebabs~487~73~25~6~14~43189~44~Kebabs are not only fun to eat, they also save time: It takes less than 10 minutes for these lamb cubes to cook up medium-rare. The marinade, made with fresh thyme and rosemary, infuses both the meat and the vegetables with south-of-France flavor.
5018566~Roasted Trout with Lentils and Verjus~1702~175~25~45~71~1860~31~Yes, there is butter in the sauce, but the key ingredient is verjus. If you can't find it, use half white wine and half unseasoned rice vinegar.
5018567~Canyon Ranch Berry Fruit Crepes~1723~304~183~87~47~40151~525~Round out your breakfast: Add 1 cup steamed skim milk (heat on stove or in microwave until milk starts to froth) topped with 2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp honey.

The subtle sweetness of the squash is enhanced by the flavors of the pears, orange, and ginger, making it a great addition also to the Thanksgiving Table.

5018578~Chipotle Onion Dip with Garlic Pita Chips~501~9~6~1~50~0~126~In this version of chips and dip—an essential snack food—making your own onion dip (spiked with chipotle chiles) really ups the ante.

5018588~Chocolate Espresso Spelt Cake~2498~543~319~136~45~3989~372~This cake is the little black dress of fiber — velvety and sophisticated. Medjool dates lend it an unbelievably unctuous texture. When measuring spelt flour, be sure to spoon it into the measuring cup and level it off to prevent packing it down; this will keep the cake light.
5018589~Peachy Keen Ice Cream~1928~396~376~15~40~291~137~Tossing the peaches in lemon juice brightens their flavor.

5018592~Pressed Coppa Sandwiches with Broccoli Rabe Pesto~2883~129~31~132~200~8768~404~"When working with big flavors, you don't need big quantities. ""There's something to be said for restraint,"" says chef Chris Kuziemko of Chicago's Publican Quality Meats, a butcher shop that uses house-cured meat to make incredible sandwiches. Take his lead and swap the grocery store cold cuts for a special cured meat like soppressata or prosciutto, and indulge in a quality cheese. You'll build something beautiful without having to supersize. Just be sure to balance all the bold notes: In this pulled-back panino, Kuziemko uses a sharp provolone to cut the fat and the slightly sweet flavor of the coppa, and honey to temper the spicy-bitter broccoli rabe pesto. Because when no single ingredient dominates, each one can shine."
5018593~Roast Duck, Butternut Squash, Cèpes, and Green Beans~216~39~15~4~0~636~0~Cèpes (also known as porcini) are perfect with roast duck. Pair this dinner-partyworthy dish with a New Zealand Pinot Noir.
5018594~Persian Spice Mix~295~59~59~0~0~0~0~Also known as advieh, this aromatic blend comes from Persian cuisine. It’s fragrant, a little sweet, and gently warming. It is delicious mixed with sugar and sprinkled over baked goods, donuts, and rice pudding or added to dried fruits that are cooking into jam. It straddles the sweet and savory world because it’s also great for flavoring rice pilaf with toasted nuts, lentil soup, lamb meatballs, braised chicken, or vegetable stew. It’s a blend that is shared by chefs and pastry chefs. Use it to make Persian-Style Carrots and Black-Eyed Peas.
5018595~Panfried Bean Burritos~1981~145~11~25~142~2984~13~Highly recommended!
5018596~Strawberry and Rhubarb Crumble~2767~398~114~58~98~322~124~The crumble is the British version of the American crisp.

A fiery dollop of chipotle mayonnaise makes them even more irresistible.
5019606~Lime and Grapefruit Daiquiri Ice Pops~1677~416~326~12~3~197~0~Refreshing and a little bit inebriating; if you've got kids running around, pick up a box of Rocket Pops so there's no confusion!

5018609~Greek Burger with Arugula, Tomatoes, and Feta~2636~280~150~140~116~5257~302~Using lamb slashes fat; mixing a milk-soaked pita into the patty keeps it moist.
5018610~"Mixed Leafy Green Soup ""Caldo Verde"" with Chickpeas"~190~21~14~9~6~435~0~"Caldo verde means ""green broth"" in Portuguese, and it is Portugal's unofficial national dish. This beautiful green soup is technically a hot smoothie, since its many nutritious greens are pureed together in a blender. Chickpeas are an important ingredient here, too. Fiber- and protein-rich, they've been shown in studies to help people lose weight. For added protein, top with 4 ounces of shredded chicken or add 2 dozen clams to the broth."

When I make this for my family I do not tell the children that it includes beets and turnips. For some unknown reason they never ask me how the dish became so red. They love it.

5018659~How to Toast Nuts~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~You can toast nuts in the oven or in a skillet. The toasting time will vary depending on the size of the nuts. Larger nuts, such as walnuts, pecans, or almonds take longer than smaller nuts such as peanuts, pine nuts, or macadamia nuts. Once cool, store them in an airtight container.
5018661~Spicy Glazed Pork Ribs~3607~141~128~297~208~10183~1130~This glaze also makes for an addictive tray of chicken wings. Use the same weight and method as for the ribs, but reduce final cooking time by 10 minutes.

5018664~Spicy Tomato Sauce from Giada de Laurentiis's Everyday Italian~743~52~5~0~59~2782~0~"The sauce known as all'arrabbiata—or ""in the angry style""—is made with hot red pepper flakes (and sometimes fresh chilies for an extra kick). I like to use the briny elements of olives and capers and skip the fresh chilies, adding depth to the spiciness rather than just more heat. Perfect with penne or rigatoni."
5018665~Rich Turkey Gravy~231~49~0~22~0~1536~0~While the turkey roasts, it releases tons of concentrated flavor into the pan—this is where the gravy takes on another dimension. As the bird rests, set the pan on your stovetop, roll up your sleeves, and get to work.

5018668~Panfried Tofu with Romano-Bean and Herb Salad~985~132~17~59~16~3679~370~Tofu is frequently paired with Asian flavors, but here it is a delicate canvas for a robust, creamy French-inspired dressing that also gussies up the seasonal side salad. Dipping the tofu in egg before it hits the skillet seals its custardy texture inside a lovely golden crust.
5018669~Tomato, Corn, and Avocado Salsa~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~This refreshing summer salsa gets some heat from serrano chile.
5018670~Beer-Brined Grilled Pork Chops~1389~326~88~46~17~28222~132~Brining the chops makes them moist.
5018671~Black Cod with Swiss Chard, Olives, and Lemon~764~44~4~2~60~1196~0~Give Swiss chard a flavor boost by adding whole chopped lemon instead of just the juice. Simmering it first softens the texture and bitter undertones. Serve this dish with Red Quinoa with Pistachios .
5018672~Puerto Rican Coconut Eggnog (Coquito)~927~175~1~32~7~590~4~In Puerto Rico, as Christmas Eve approaches, groups of carolers playing the güiro (a percussion instrument made from a gourd), the cuatro (a four-stringed guitar), and maracas visit friends and neighbors, asking for food and drink. They are usually greeted with coquito, a frothy coconut drink spiked with rum. Here is my Puerto Rican cousin Elbita's recipe, with a couple of touches of my own.
5018673~Russian Walnut-Cherry Latkes with Cherry-Apple Sauce~1662~137~73~36~102~721~493~The sauce for these cheese-based latkes, which are great for breakfast, can be made two days ahead. Be sure to serve the pancakes (enough for four people) as soon as they are made.

5018677~Broiled Lamb Chops with Mint Chimichurri~1720~72~32~22~149~908~144~Here, the sunny warmth of mint escapes the sweet-jelly cliché to find new expression in the thick Argentinean herb sauce called chimichurri. Its bright acidity cuts the lush richness of lamb shoulder chops.
5018681~Fresh Corn Quiche~2792~429~23~64~96~3622~464~The Mainstay Inn offers this simple brunch dish.
5018682~Leek and Ginger Matzo Balls in Lemongrass Consommé~853~112~65~25~20~3392~740~Any fat from the consommé can be used to make the matzo balls. If you need to purchase chicken fat, it's available in the freezer section of some supermarkets. Look for fresh lemongrass in supermarkets and Asian markets.

5018686~Baked Flaxseed Crab Cakes~1448~87~9~144~69~2029~495~You don’t have to book a reservation at your favorite seafood house to dig into flaky crab cakes—just make these simple ones in your broiler at home! Crab is an overlooked superfood, low in calories and high in complete protein, vitamin B12, and zinc, all key building blocks of your body and brain. Flaxseeds and hemp seeds bring in fiber and protein, so you stay full longer. If you spy reddish microgreens or fresh nasturtiums at your local farmers’ market, they will make lovely garnishes for this gourmet meal and add a spicy note.
5018687~Artichokes with Bagna Cauda~1479~43~0~3~144~381~94~Bagna cauda is a warm, garlicky dip traditionally served with raw vegetables. It hails from northwestern Italy's Piedmont region. In this version, the sauce is served with cooked artichokes. And dont be scared off by the three heads of garlic called for in this recipe. Simmering the garlic mellows its flavor significantly.
5018688~Na'ama's Fattoush~799~69~17~6~55~39433~0~"Arab salad, chopped salad, Israeli salad—whatever you choose to call it, there is no escaping it. Wherever you go, a Jerusalemite is most likely to have a plate of freshly chopped vegetables—tomato, cucumber, and onion, dressed with olive oil and lemon juice—served next to whatever else they are having. It's a local affliction, quite seriously. Friends visiting us in London always complain of feeling they ate ""unhealthily"" because there wasn't a fresh salad served with every meal."
5018689~All American Turkey~1730~136~95~29~120~5344~367~Present the turkey before carving it. I suggest garnishing it with fresh sage and kumquats.
5019572~Turkey Shawarma with Tomato Relish and Tahini Sauce~2573~65~7~273~126~5383~658~Shawarma is the Middle Eastern version of a large vertical shish kebab known as doner kebab in Turkey and gyro in Greece. It's made by impaling layers of meat on an oversize spit with a flat base and roasting the meat in an upright rotisserie. There are at least three advantages to this singular method of cooking. The dripping fat bastes the meat below it; the meat is sliced to order (at least it should be) from the outside, which gives every customer a crusty end cut; and because the crusty meat slices are piled on pita bread with fresh vegetables, pickles, and tahini sauce, you get a whole meal—and a healthful one—in a single sandwich. Traditionally, shawarma was made with lamb, but more and more Israeli grill masters use thinly sliced chicken or turkey. Shawarma is easy to prepare if you have a vertical rotisserie, and somewhat more challenging to adapt to the home grill. But direct-grilling the turkey slices does give you a close approximation of the taste and texture of classic shawarma.

5018696~Thyme Honey Glazed Ham~785~124~116~0~34~82~94~Hams with a thick honey glaze can sometimes be too cloying. This recipe takes a more balanced approach that results in a light sweetness and a beautiful shine.

5018712~Grilled Salmon with Tomato, Cucumber and Caper Salsa~390~81~4~9~0~1680~0~The salmon can be grilled two ways. The first method requires a fish-grilling basket, which can be found at many cookware and barbecue stores (use one that's about 18 by 6 inches for this recipe). The second technique doesn't call for any special equipment at all — just a rimless baking sheet and a spatula.
5018716~Dominican Beans~584~66~11~6~30~40611~0~Sweetened by pepper and rounded out with cilantro, vinegar, and tomato paste, this Latin American staple is perfect with anything on your table or as a meal itself.

5018732~Blackberry and Blueberry–Ginger Yogurt Pots~313~44~30~17~4~330~20~These berries don’t need much cooking time to stew down. However, you can change the fruits to apples, pears or even quinces and cook them in the slow cooker on low for about 5 hours. Let the slow cooker revolution continue! Best way forward for this brekky is to cook the fruit (frozen works well, too) and oats in batches so you have enough to last you throughout the week.

5018737~Grilled Wild Salmon With Garlic Scape Pesto and Summer Squash~1876~64~6~61~160~2574~164~"Wild salmon tops the list of fish that are high in omega-3 and low in mercury. So swap out farmed
salmon, which contains food dyes, for the real thing. Frozen sides of wild salmon offer the best value.
Garlic scapes are the young, soft stems and unopened flower buds of hardneck garlic. This variety of
garlic tends to be prevalent at farmer's markets. The season for scapes is short, so if you can't find them you can substitute scallions or baby leeks."
5018738~Beef Tartare with Cherry Peppers~833~78~33~37~40~2170~35~Firming the beef in the freezer makes it easier to cut.

5018782~Seafood Cannelloni~1709~29~8~29~156~5040~669~We have given no-boil lasagne noodles as an alternative to fresh because regular dried lasagne noodles often have curly edges and are too thick.
5018783~Halibut with Herb Sauce~989~11~10~0~109~5~0~The halibut is delicious with sautéed green beans and steamed new potatoes. End with espresso granita or ice cream with grappa.
5018785~Oysters with Finger Lime and Ginger Mignonette~479~24~1~28~29~935~5~In place of vinegar, finger limes give this mignonette its zing (pulp from regular limes works just as well).
5018787~Mushroom Goat Cheese Pan Sauce~342~51~2~16~7~904~20~For chicken and turkey cutlets, boneless pork chops and tenderloin, steaks, and burgers. You can't offer a series of pan sauces without a mushroom one. I have chosen shiitakes, since they sauté more quickly than other mushrooms. Rather than using cream or butter, enrich this sauce with fresh goat cheese.

5018793~Mexican Chocolate Ice Cream Cake with Orange Meringue~3766~553~483~70~154~1938~404~The combination of chocolate and cinnamon gives this treat its Mexican flavor. The cake needs to freeze overnight, so be sure to plan ahead.
5018795~Whole Roasted Cauliflower with Olive Oil and Capers~36~5~3~1~0~1962~0~Roasting a whole head of cauliflower at high heat creates beautifully caramelized florets. It's perfectly offset by fresh parsley and a drizzle of a quick lemon dressing.
5018796~Grilled Bell Peppers with Criolla Sauce~538~47~8~0~37~2843~0~Criolla is traditionally served as a sauce for grilled meats, but we tossed it with bell peppers as an accompaniment or side dish. If you're making this with the Spinach and Carrot Stuffed Flank Steak, grill the bell peppers before you start cooking the steak.
5018797~Sweet-Potato-Pecan Pie~3924~523~355~35~195~2149~433~"""I have a 'stragglers Thanksgiving' — that's what I call it — at my house every year,"" writes Frances Teasley of North Hollywood, California. ""I know a lot of people who, like me, don't have any family nearby. Thirteen years ago I started inviting a few people for dinner. And that small holiday gathering has become a big tradition among my friends. For weekday meals, I look for shortcuts and do-aheads. But for holiday meals, I like to do everything the same day because I love the smell of cooking that fills the house."""

5018803~Chicken Tagine with Apricots and Spiced Pine Nuts~1917~227~48~28~110~1284~93~"""There is no typical tagine of Algeria—the country is too big, and the cooks are all too opinionated to agree on a typical dish,"" says Zadi. Still, this version epitomizes the spirit of Algerian cooking, with many flavors in perfect balance and no single ingredient overwhelming the others. And we found the savory, juicy meat (simmered with blood-orange preserves and apricots) and the spiced toasted pine nuts to be an absolutely delicious combination."
5018804~Preserved Meyer Lemons~473~0~0~0~55~0~0~Preserving a Meyer lemon captures its glorious perfume. We’ve adapted cookbook author Paula Wolfert’s quick method, our favorite, and made it even faster by blanching the lemons first. The rind of a preserved lemon is a common ingredient in Moroccan dishes; we also love it in all kinds of soups, stews, and salads and as a low-fat alternative to olives. Save the pulp for Bloody Marys or anything else enlivened by a little lemon juice and salt.

5018816~Veal Meatballs and Baby Carrots in Dilled Cream Sauce~3470~282~92~226~336~5614~1412~Although the most authentic Swedish meatballs are not sauced, this creamy dill-and mustard-spiked dish is nevertheless hearty, comforting and flavored with ingredients popular in Swedish cooking. The meatballs are served over caraway noodles to capture every drop of the delectable sauce. Uncork a Chardonnay to go with the meal.
5018817~Stewed Turkey with Herbs and Onions~601~88~35~426~187~4958~1243~If you have never thought to boil a turkey, this 1623 recipe will make a believer out of you. While the original recipe calls for a whole bird, the modern recipe is adapted to use with prepackaged turkey pieces. If you would like use a small whole bird (10-12 pounds), cut it into ten pieces before boiling—it is really difficult and potentially dangerous to lift a whole steaming turkey from a pot of boiling broth. For this larger amount of turkey, you will need to double the other ingredients.

5018822~Poached Fish with Spinach in Chili-Tomato Sauce~2543~196~85~58~118~4963~66~I like this one because it's a one-pan dish—you will need a pan with a lid. You can use a can of tomatoes instead of making the purée if you wish, but puréeing the tomatoes produces a better result. You don't need to be precise with the quantities for this dish at all—a handful of cherry tomatoes, add some onion, etc. The important thing is to have the lid to keep in steam and heat so you get a very nice lightly cooked fish. You don't want to overcook it. I've used hake but you can use any white fish like cod, sea bass, halibut or even salmon. It's simple but tasty, and the kind of thing you could easily rustle up for yourself or friends. You can use any green veg but it works well with fennel—sautéed in a pan or slow-baked, or added to the pan and cooked with the fish and tomatoes. This is a great one for a novice cook.
5018823~Oxtail and Lima Bean Stew~5150~454~83~563~599~31431~1673~Oxtail stew is a popular dish in Jamaica. Here's a recipe from Geva's in San Francisco that adds lima beans and a touch of heat from jalapeño chilies for a terrific rendition.

5018833~Swiss Chard Salsa Verde~1522~17~7~2~166~239~0~This deceptively simple condiment is as addictive as pesto and as transformative as a squeeze of lemon. Spoon it onto fish, chicken, steak, roasted vegetables, or even pasta.
5018834~Coffee, Hazelnut and Raspberry Torte~7124~881~636~105~375~1184~1212~A beautiful special-occasion dessert that can be prepared a day before serving. Any leftover raspberry filling is delicious on toast or pancakes.

We tend to eat light, and I cook with foods that are in season since I've never been one for complicated dishes. It's just not my style.

5018837~Lavash~1095~190~1~92~46~2572~115~With its tantalizing aroma of garlic, sesame, and Asiago cheese, this Middle Eastern flatbread may well be gone before you can even put it on the table.
5018838~Beer-Braised Brisket with Onions~831~136~95~12~27~1490~0~There are two brisket cuts available in most supermarkets, and the labeling can often be confusing. If you prefer a more marbled piece of beef, look for the thicker end, known as the point half, which may be labeled the front, thick, second, or nose cut. The thinner, leaner end of the brisket is the flat half, sometimes called the first or thin cut.

A little fancier than a fruit salad yet almost as easy, this cool combination of musky cantaloupe and honeydew gets an unexpected fillip from icy granita. Dont worry if the granita melts faster than you expect—it will slump into a lovely sauce over the fruit.

5018852~Welsh Rarebit Fingers~1438~233~17~31~35~1909~94~"This Welsh dish is also called ""rabbit."" The name rabbit may be traceable to the fact that the Welsh, who live in prime dairy land, were as fond of melted cheese as they were of rabbit. ""Rarebit"" may have been a later gentrification of the word, or a reference to the texture of this rare (soft) dish. Either way, it is excellent served in bite-size pieces for a party."

5018858~Coconut, Beet, and Ginger Soup~2064~290~235~66~47~6673~119~There are many ways to make beet soup, the most well-known of all being borscht, the hearty Russian classic that also contains veggies like potatoes and cabbage. Beet soup can be eaten cold, so we like to make it with more delicate flavors and puree it. Here, the ginger beautifully balances the beet, and the coconut milk adds a nice fat component. We find citrus finishes this dish perfectly, so we garnish it with a bit of orange.

5018872~Caponata~3172~73~49~4~339~8794~0~The levels of sweet and sour in caponata vary from household to household. In this version, the onions and celery are caramelized for incredible depth of flavor—which improves over time.
5018873~Poached Seckel Pear with Pomegranate, Cabrales Cheese, and Szechuan Pepper Ice Cream~1887~283~219~90~54~1717~513~Here's another dessert that was inspired by a wine-tasting dinner. It's often hard to come up with a dessert that pairs well with wine, but this savory-sweet dessert does. At its center is a Seckel pear, a small, reddish pear with a slightly spicy flavor. It has a firm flesh that makes it perfect for poaching. In this dessert I poach the pears in pomegranate juice with some ground black pepper. A chunk of Cabrales cheese, a strong blue cheese from northern Spain, is sandwiched between the top and bottom halves of the pear, and a Szechuan Ice Cream is served with it, sitting on a diamond of baked almond cream.

5018909~Berry, Beet, Mint, Lime, and Chia Seed Smoothie~472~98~67~3~5~258~0~The liquid is really up to you. Nut milks add body and protein, but if you prefer something sweeter, try juice. Less heavy? Go with coconut water.

5018912~Stuffed Leg of Lamb (Fakdeh Mehshi Khodra)~2483~563~239~45~4~4750~0~When there is a whole lamb on the Arab table, the occasion is a special one. It is prepared to celebrate the birth of a child, a marriage, the return from a pilgrimage, or the recuperation from illness. For the host, it is an opportunity to honor the guests, showing them how important they are. When I was growing up, my mother always prepared it for the Eid al Adha, the celebration for the end of the pilgrimage to Mecca.
5018913~Potato and Shiitake Mushroom Gratin~5140~86~21~234~414~15910~1527~Potato gratin is, of course, the traditional side dish with roast beef, and this version is just right for a special occasion. Adding flavor are typical steak house ingredients, like mushrooms, garlic and herbs. Place a baking sheet in the oven on the rack below the gratin to catch any liquids that may bubble over.
5018914~Red Bell Pepper, Spinach, and Goat Cheese Salad with Oregano Dressing~759~24~18~31~65~1524~125~This delicious and easy-to-make salad would be nice with grilled lamb or steak.

5018918~Sweet-Potato Hash with Bacon~4846~706~143~147~146~24136~261~Using the pan drippings to sauté the vegetables allows the bacon's smokiness to permeate the whole dish. It's a striking complement to the sweet potatoes and red peppers. And don't fret about making too much—you won't have leftovers for long. The flavors will meld further and make for a terrific breakfast the next day.
5018919~Lamb Chops with Roasted-Eggplant Relish~396~8~5~0~43~525~0~Lamb shoulder chops are everything a cook wants: They're inexpensive and quick-cooking, yet they deliver more robust flavor than pricier rib chops.

5018924~Caesar-Style Salad~350~17~10~28~17~25000~64~This take on classic Caesar salad uses nonfat yogurt in place of oil and egg (or oil and mayonnaise) for a lean but creamy dressing that is enhanced by grated Parmesan.
5018925~Pasta with Roasted Vegetables, Tomatoes, and Basil~4383~660~34~96~153~1341~177~Great served warm or at room temperature.
5018927~Spiced Apple Pie with Raisins~6456~1178~546~76~150~2458~410~Apple cider vinegar makes the crust extra flaky. Offer eggnog ice cream (or vanilla ice cream sprinkled with nutmeg) alongside.
5018928~Linguine With Clams (Linguine Con le Vongole)~3414~377~8~81~173~21618~63~In contrast to American renditions of this dish, which often feature a heavy tomato sauce, the Italian version focuses on the pasta itself. The clam and tomato accompaniment is light and simple. Red pepper flakes add a bit of heat, but you can reduce the amount if you prefer less spice.
5018929~Catalan Spinach~3139~250~164~38~247~96~0~Highly recommended!

5018937~Red Wine–Marinated Hanger Steaks with Flatbreads~2440~85~9~50~198~3763~346~When it comes to marinating these steaks, go long. Time adds intense flavor, the wine helps tenderize, and you can get it going before you hit the road.
5018938~Perfect Coddled Egg~375~51~0~17~9~761~35~Just when we thought there were no new ways to cook an egg, along came these adorable little vessels that yield soft-boiled meals in a cup.
5018939~Tandoori-Style Grilled Chicken~1174~87~42~35~70~4600~217~This recipe adapts traditional Indian tandoori cooking for a barbecue. The chicken needs to marinate overnight, so start this one day ahead.
5018940~Zucchini Vichyssoise~3451~450~155~62~146~5475~529~Zucchini gives a summery twist to the classic leek-and-potato soup; this new take on an old favorite is served at Quisiana.
5018941~Deborah Madison's Roasted Squash, Pear, and Ginger Soup~1119~82~44~6~72~1115~200~This fall soup is like putting on the first sweater of the season: it just feels so good. Although the soup takes several steps—roasting the squash and pears (which can be done a day ahead of time), cooking them, and finally pureeing the soup—none involve much from you. It's an easily made soup that will keep well for days—a great possibility for a holiday meal.
5018942~Grilled New Potatoes with Parmesan and Herbs~5595~1057~208~121~91~30603~36~An easy side dish with flavor from green onions, parsley, oregano and Parmesan.

5018945~Blood-Orange Rum Punch~1181~226~189~8~23~592~0~We recommend using a good-quality California or Spanish sparkling wine for this punch. Both are widely available and less expensive than Champagne.

5018973~Corvina Traditional~625~162~158~80~21~6457~295~This recipe epitomizes what a great ceviche should be—crunchy, sweet, savory, tart, and rich all in one bite. Corvina, a type of sea bass, is the most widely used fish in South America for ceviche, and is very forgiving for the novice. Its firm, lean flesh holds up better to acid and is easy to either thinly slice or dice.
5018975~Moroccan-Style Mussels~751~63~23~14~46~1148~47~Chickpeas transform saucy mussels into a meal that's as hearty as it is seductive.

5018994~Dried Fig, Apricot, and Cherry Slump~5268~897~540~144~118~8234~421~This homey dessert gets its name from its lack of structure, which causes it to slump on the plate. Slumps are also known as grunts, a name that may describe the sound berries make as they cook. No matter which name you use, this old-fashioned treat is usually made of cooked fruit with a biscuit topping. Here, dried figs, apricots, tart cherries, and raisins make up the filling. The light, airy biscuits are similar to dumplings.
5018996~Creamed Peas and Onions~1064~77~59~23~72~3526~234~Peas and onions are a classic holiday duo. Relying on frozen ones, along with a quick béchamel, is a smart move on a busy day of cooking.

5019001~Aunt Enza's Overstewed Green Beans~791~59~12~3~58~943~0~I, who struggled for years to achieve perfectly cooked, lively green beans love Aunt Enza's overstewed green beans, soft, almost creamy, tasting of bean, cooked far beyond crunch. Although Aunt Enza cooks the green beans in an onion and garlic-flavored tomato sauce she pointed out that leftover green beans can be subjected to the same treatment. Aunt Enza has a heavy Tuscan hand with extra virgin. I've cut down on the oil but my husband Massimo always adds a little extra at the table.
5019002~Roasted Clams with Pancetta and Red Bell Pepper Coulis~885~61~3~32~53~2053~59~In 1917, a society grande dame asked Julius Keller, maître d’ of the Casino restaurant in New York, to surprise her with a new dish. Keller presented clams baked on the half shell, topped with minced bell pepper, herb butter and bacon. By the twenties, Clams Casino, as Keller called it, was ubiquitous on restaurant menus. Here is a lightened version with great lively flavors.
5019003~Yemenite High Holy Day Soup~3717~169~63~269~207~3794~765~My mother-in-law remembers the kapparah tradition in Poland. Early in the morning of the day prior to Yom Kippur, a fowl was whirled about her head, while she thought about turning over a new leaf. Her father would whirl a rooster, her mother a hen, and her brothers and sisters a pullet or a cockerel. The ceremony was repeated for each child. She was always frightened by the fluttering feathers. After the whirling, her mother would race to the shohet and have the fowls ritually slaughtered to make food for the meal before the fast. All the fowls would be cooked, and any extras given to bachelor relatives or to the poor. Chicken soup would be made for the kreplakh and the boiled chicken eaten as a mild main dish.
5019004~New England Crab Rolls~1170~11~2~83~90~2113~521~Creamy lobster salad heaped onto a buttered, toasted hot dog bun is the quintessential summer sandwich in northeastern shore towns. This is an equally delicious — and more economical — variation.

5019007~Nana's Butter Cookies with Milk-Jam Filling~5336~654~400~149~309~6032~879~The caramelized milk jam makes for a decadent little sandwich, but these cookies are amazingly good simply eaten on their own.
5019008~Beef and Napa Cabbage Stir-Fry~1390~86~4~93~72~6012~204~You don't need an endless supply of ingredients to create a flavor-packed stir-fry. Here, flank steak and fresh Napa cabbage come together without fuss, thanks to a Chinese sauce that requires little work.

5019012~Spinach with Olives, Raisins and Pine Nuts~1034~40~1~7~96~0~0~Highly recommended!
5019013~"Buttermilk Cabbage Soup With Black Walnut ""Pesto"""~994~53~31~23~80~3795~63~"Cabbage is a green you can keep in the root cellar deep into the winter, and it is often sliced thin and sautéed in butter or bacon grease as a sturdy side for a cold-weather supper. This soup pairs it perfectly with tangy buttermilk and the fragrantly earthy black walnuts that fall in abundance in the autumn. Black walnuts are a bear to get to, their outer husks staining hands a deep purplish black, the inner shells so hard that it breaks the nut meats inside to crack them. But they are so beloved and flavorful that mountain families would spend long winter evenings peeling, cracking, and picking black walnuts by the fire.
If you don’t have or don’t like black walnuts, you can make the “pesto” with pecans. It will be great, but just different."
5019015~Walnut, Golden Raisin, and Fennel Seed Scones~3278~455~113~78~73~2455~197~The fennel seeds add a nice dimension to these tender scones.

5019018~Porcini Matzo Polenta Wedges~306~12~6~1~30~2013~0~Although polenta is traditionally made with cornmeal, we substituted matzo meal—with great results. It's far more tender than regular polenta, and tastes especially wonderful with the sauce from the braised veal with gremolata .
5019019~Brioche Gaga~1129~65~65~13~89~3107~591~Highly recommended!

5019023~Carrot Cake~5287~723~467~121~305~3090~370~We serve a lot of carrot cake with cream cheese frosting. People love the moist cake with the creamy frosting—and, from our informal polling, our customers prefer their carrot cake without raisins or nuts and with lots of cream cheese frosting!
5019024~Goat Cheese Croquettes With Spiced Membrillo~2984~526~82~145~70~2530~529~We’ll be spreading membrillo (quince paste) inside bread for grilled cheese from now on. This recipe is from Morcilla, one of Bon Appétit's Hot 10, America's Best New Restaurants 2016.

5019026~Coriander Lime Pesto~564~9~2~22~49~342~36~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5019032~Dark Chocolate and Orange Tart with Toasted Almonds~6243~642~397~105~391~2114~692~Reminiscent of fragrant Mexican chocolate (which is spiced with cinnamon), and as fudgy as a chocolate truffle, this dessert will serve many more than six, but leftovers will keep for at least a week in the refrigerator.
5019033~Turkey-Tomato Stew with Onions and Raisins~1828~169~97~78~91~4403~241~This is a kind of picadillo, a typical Spanish stew. It's also a great way to use up the (usually) less popular dark meat from the turkey. Readily available pumpkin pie spice introduces a touch of sweetness — and makes a nice addition to the spice shelf. Accompany this dish with steamed rice, a basket of warm tortillas, and an arugula and red onion salad.

5019039~Sausage and Summer Vegetable Sauté~540~31~13~18~36~1561~77~Sure, go ahead and cook your favorite sausages, but be sure to use every iota of their flavor: Reheat the skillet and work some pork-based magic on a seasonal array of onion, fennel, tomatoes, and corn.
5019040~Scalloped Potatoes~6454~1028~220~105~205~30557~586~There's no question: If meatloaf, then potatoes. These have all the comfort of mashed, but with a nice texture from the potato slices and from being baked in cream. And they can go in the oven along with the meatloaf, so dinner will be ready all at once.
5019042~Grilled Pork Tenderloin Cutlets with Chili Maple Glaze~189~19~19~22~3~9066~58~Highly recommended!
5019043~Pimient d'Espelette Mayonnaise~1542~19~2~0~168~1610~253~This subtly spicy mayo is great on fish and sandwiches—and on fries, too.

5019050~Japanese-Style Grilled Fish~450~60~55~22~2~3865~56~"Most freshwater and ocean fish can be marinated for only 30 minutes at most—or they turn opaque and are essentially ""cooked"" before you even go out to the grill. The exception, though, is strong-flavored, oily fish like amberjack, bluefish, salmon, mackerel, marlin, mullet, or even our old standby, farm-raised catfish, which can stand up to longer marinating. In fact, marinating these oily fish for a longer time makes them taste even better."

""The food is great—especially the caldo de maìz (corn soup) that I had for lunch."""
5019062~Fish Masala~517~34~1~21~16~1991~36~We found that 1 green chile was enough, but add more if you like things fiery.
5019063~Almond-Barley Porridge with Fruit~4576~647~439~78~195~2680~427~Live in a magical place where cloudberries abound? Use them instead of the cherries, as they do in Norway.

5019080~Celery Root Bisque with Duck Confit and Cracklings~1387~35~17~35~118~419~462~The duck leg confit brings added richness to the bisque, but the soup is also delicious without it.

5019083~Strawberry Roulade~1477~125~83~37~94~2408~416~This strawberry roll is elegant in appearance but less rich than a roll covered with whipped cream rather than the light meringue.
5019084~Scallops Provençale~932~80~14~86~37~900~140~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5019085~Brown Butter Dutch Baby~941~93~19~49~61~801~517~A Dutch Baby is somewhere between a custard, a crepe, and a pancake, and it couldn’t be simpler to make. All the ingredients get whipped together in a blender for a super-airy texture and minimal cleanup.
5019086~Baked Herb-Crusted Chicken Breasts~1840~280~29~53~50~4323~108~Tenderize the boneless chicken breast halves by flattening them as you would for a chicken piccata, then marinating in lemon juice. What to drink: A crisp Sauvignon Blanc is ideal with both the breaded chicken and the asparagus risotto.
5019087~Blackberry-Raspberry Pie~4864~1102~409~91~0~1110~0~This pie has an exceptionally flaky crust. It's wonderful — of course — with vanilla ice cream.

5019090~Charred Green Beans with Lemon Verbena Pesto~1570~55~11~28~136~968~59~If you grow pole beans, you know that at first glance, you have only a few beans, and then suddenly there is an onslaught. That's when bean varieties like the green Blue Lake or the yellow wax beans can be stir-grilled with a bit of olive oil for a very simple yet satisfying dish to use the surplus of beans. When you're in the mood for a more robust sauce, try this lemony pesto tossed with the grilled beans right before serving.
5019092~Broccoli with Toasted Garlic Crumbs~196~37~2~3~0~513~0~Wonderfully crunchy, toasted panko transforms an ordinary vegetable into a truly special side dish.

5019100~Planter's Punch I~235~35~21~3~8~140~39~Highly recommended!
5019102~Bite-Size Stollen (Stollenkonfekt)~3361~467~367~50~154~1855~252~Making Stollen is not for the faint of heart. Avoiding it altogether because excellent store-bought Stollen abounds is further abetted by the invention of Stollenkonfekt, bite-size chunks of spiced, tender Quark dough studded with almonds and raisins and thickly cloaked in vanilla-scented confectioners’ sugar. They may be a relatively recent development in the world of Christstollen, which dates back to the Middle Ages, but they more than make up for their youth. In other words, want the rich, buttery, spicy flavor of Stollen without the work of a yeasted dough and the weeks of impatiently waiting for the loaves to be ready? If so, Stollenkonfekt is the thing for you.
5019103~Chicken Skewers with Meyer Lemon Salsa~1366~43~5~131~71~40622~617~This versatile salsa also pairs well with scallops or roast fish.

5019106~Slow-Roasted Halibut with Shaved Asparagus and Fennel Salad~938~11~7~22~88~2784~138~Thinly shaving the asparagus gives the familiar vegetable a new look—and a delicate taste. Because the asparagus is shaved so thinly, there is no need to cook it.
5019107~Norwegian Meatballs with Spiced Cream Sauce~1239~124~21~76~93~3101~295~Highly recommended!
5019108~Spinach, Fennel, and Sausage Stuffing with Toasted Brioche~2526~226~21~101~138~9891~888~The addition of airy brioche gives this aromatic spiced stuffing a less dense texture than most holiday casseroles.
5019110~D.I.Y. Apple Mille-Feuille~1893~96~52~13~168~622~444~Sandwiching the puff pastry between two baking sheets ensures that the pastry rises perfectly even.
5019111~Seared Scallops with Lemon and Dill~635~10~4~15~46~1451~157~Couscous with fresh herbs, and steamed green beans sprinkled with toasted pine nuts would be lovely accompaniments. Dessert? Try warm apple turnovers from the bakery; top with ice cream.
5019112~Sea Bass in Papillote~1048~43~6~15~85~2534~53~Traditional papillote takes time and requires origami-like folding. Here, we use foil to make a no-mess pouch; the fish becomes infused with the flavors of tomato, capers, garlic, and lemon.
5019113~Tri-Tip Roast with Parsley Cherry-Tomato~285~33~0~0~13~3877~0~This cut of meat yields a juicy roast with no fuss. And the spicy parsley sauce is tasty enough to keep some on hand for chicken, fish, or pasta.
5019114~Lamb and Ratatouille Kebabs~2476~230~152~106~128~43842~411~Highly recommended!
5019115~Braised Birria~2496~127~105~107~174~6279~227~Though Birrieria Zaragoza in Chicago uses goat shoulder, this deeply spiced braise is equally good with lamb.
5019116~Potato, Sage, and Rosemary Pizza~2855~289~49~138~132~10682~245~Add a salad and your meal is set. Or serve small squares for an appetizer.

5019121~Chili Chicken Wings~1604~364~301~15~15~6154~62~Most of these ingredients can be found in the Asian section of any supermarket. Frequent basting makes the wings shine!

5019127~Torquato's Herb and Garlic Baked Tomatoes~659~37~3~0~55~15~0~"I love many versions of baked stuffed tomatoes, but the simple recipe of Torquato Innocenti, who sells tomatoes in Florence's Piazza Santo Spirito market, is my favorite. Nothing more than garlic, basil or parsley, and ""good oil"" fills the tomatoes."
5019128~Artichoke, Goat Cheese and Chicken Pizza~1277~62~20~76~85~3084~166~Using goat cheese and nonfat ricotta skims fat, not flavor.

5019141~Mint Julep I~599~81~14~23~13~704~74~Silver mugs are often used for juleps, as some people think they frost better than glass. A glass mug with a handle may also be used so that the hands need not touch the frosted surface. A slice each or orange and lemon, a pineapple spear and a maraschino cherry are sometimes used for garnish, and a splash of rum or brandy may be added to the drink.

5019146~Chicken en Papillote~831~117~67~28~20~4630~45~"The French prince: Jean-Georges Vongerichten, executive chef and co-owner of Jean-Georges, Jo Jo, Lipstick Cafe, Mercer Kitchen, and Vong in New York City. What you'll love: No-mess cooking — just wrap the chicken and vegetables in foil, then bake and serve. Our taster says it all: ""Super easy and very delicious."""
5019147~Bbq Onion Steaks with Honey-Mustard Sauce~952~57~51~1~78~1682~63~Big, thick slices of sweet onion get a quick glaze.
5019148~Thai Fish Curry~378~35~2~0~19~128~1~The mild spice paste is also great used as a base for chicken and shrimp curries.
5019151~Lime, Apricot, and Soy-Sauce Chicken Wings~8989~199~94~707~583~15195~2760~These sweet, tangy wings should appeal to even the pickiest kid. Eight pounds may sound like a lot, but no matter how many of these we made in our test kitchens, they always disappeared quickly. You may not have the oven space to cook the wings and the macaroni simultaneously. We found it best to do the wings first, then keep them warm under foil while baking the macaroni. Finally, because the wings tend to leave a mess to clean up, we like to make them in disposable foil roasting pans.
5019152~Raspberry-Rose Gin Rickey~1431~302~272~4~0~0~0~A Gin Rickey is a mix of gin, lime juice, and club soda. We've added crushed raspberries and rose water, which makes the berry flavor sing. Any gin will work, but the cucumber and rose notes of Hendrick's are particularly good here. Garnish with lime slices and whole berries.
5019153~Vegetable Stir-Fry with Garlic-Miso Sauce~662~42~3~6~49~639~15~Thai red chilies are used at Keo's, but a sliced jalapeño chili will work just as well.

5019156~Arugula, Golden Cherries, Marcona Almonds and Parmigiano-Reggiano~2151~215~161~49~123~780~56~Though inspired by golden cherries from the farmers' market, this pretty salad can be made with any sort of fresh or frozen cherry. Marcona almonds hail from Spain; their toasty, slightly sweet and salty flavor is a great match for the fruit. Toasted whole almonds and a few extra pinches of sea salt can be substituted.
5019157~Parmesan Chicken with Caesar Roasted Romaine~2140~169~39~76~128~3491~165~The heat chars the edges of the romaine leaves and softens the inner layers.
5019158~Crunchy Chicken in Green Sauce~1009~25~26~31~48~4027~45~This southwestern version of fried chicken needs only two sides: purchased Mexican-style rice pilaf and a sauté of bell peppers and carrots. Flan with sliced kiwi would be a nice finish. Look for ancho chili powder in the spice section of your supermarket.
5019159~Grilled Rib Eye with Paprika Vinaigrette~1443~42~35~0~147~20~0~Smoky, sweet, crusty, and beefy, with charred bones to gnaw on: If this isn't a perfect steak, we don't know what is.

5019167~Puerto Rican Pineapple Rum Cake~7460~1162~871~137~357~1426~1002~"Chef Kris Wessel of Florida Cookery in Miami Beach, Florida, shared this recipe as part of a Palm Tree Christmas menu he created exclusively for Epicurious. At Wessel family Christmases at Grandmother Esther's house in Miami Beach, the main courses were Florida-centric, but the desserts were not. This particular rum cake was often served by one of Wessel's aunts. ""I think all the Irish side of our family loved it because it was loaded with rum,"" he says, joking that they'd often add more to the glaze than the recipe called for. The alcohol will burn off, but you can also omit the rum glaze and just serve with ice cream."
5019169~Goddess Guacamole~487~109~55~16~4~1024~0~This rich guacamole is the ideal skinny dip. Creamy avocado isn't just velvety- smooth on the tongue—it also helps to keep your skin soft and supple thanks to its pro-vitamin A compounds, which are thought to help prevent wrinkles.
5019171~Cheddar-Chive Scones~2762~322~24~141~209~7367~662~Highly recommended!
5019172~Tomato, Mint, and Red Onion Salad~624~118~77~3~16~1445~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5019173~Spaghetti Carbonara with Pork Belly and Fresh Peas~4398~454~17~196~191~8809~792~The pork belly needs to cure overnight, so start this one day ahead. If you can't find pork belly, use bacon instead. Mix 12 ounces diced browned bacon, 2 tablespoons drippings, 1 minced garlic clove, 1/2 cup chicken broth, and 1/4 cup dry white wine in large skillet. Bring to simmer; keep warm. Cook pasta; proceed with recipe.
5019174~Chai Pots de Crème~2827~255~252~16~163~432~660~These creamy custards feature the flavors of chai, a spiced tea that's enhanced with cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and ginger.
5019175~Apple Gingerbread Cake With Cream~2927~660~435~99~57~5872~527~You can use the same weight in regular apples for this gingerbread cake recipe, but don’t the little lady apples just look so awesome?!
5019176~Grilled Lamb, Potato, Bean and Mushroom Salad~6118~1217~242~151~28~39300~0~The mustard dressing is used both to marinate the lamb and to coat the salad. And don't let the anchovies in the dressing scare you off. They add depth of flavor, but not a fishy taste. Complete this dish with a chilled Beaujolais.
5019177~Maple-Barbecued Pork Burgers~1205~89~35~49~71~2300~199~Fill your plate with corn on the cob, sweet-potato chips, and dill pickles. For dessert, have watermelon wedges and sugar cookies.

5019179~Flank Steak~301~34~0~16~6~411~45~For an alternative marinade, combine 3 tablespoons each red-wine vinegar and olive oil with salt and pepper.
5019180~Chipotle Beef Chili with Lime Crema~3000~413~180~115~95~13678~103~A typical chili of the depression years consisted of cheap meat stretched by even cheaper beans. Chili remained modestly popular even when the hard times waned, until Lyndon Johnson boosted its national profile during the 1960s. Now chili is back and bigger than ever. Even with the modern addition of smoked jalapeños (chipotles), the inclusion of black beans and beer, and a stylish drizzle of lime crema, this recipe is a classic-hot, hearty and filling.

Sounds awesome, right? Of course it's awesome—how the hell can you screw something like that up? Of course, we eventually tired of awesome and needed to go past that to ""mind blowing."" So we decided to roll the entire damn thing in crushed-up pretzels and pour more chocolate over the top. You're welcome."

5019217~Red Berry Sauce~238~57~45~2~0~0~0~Why use frozen berries in the summer, when local fruit is at its peak? Because we love fresh local berries so much when whole or, in the case of strawberries, when sliced as well, puréeing them seems almost a sacrilege. If, however, you've got a surplus of fresh berries, go ahead and purée them.

5019239~Raw Blueberry Tartlets~1264~251~218~5~3~10~0~Fruit may become your first choice for dessert after you try this dish: Fresh blueberries are the ideal topping for the almond-date crust.

5019243~Chicken Fricassée with Lemon Mustard Sauce~3142~108~55~5~282~7440~723~There may be more sauce than you need to serve with the chicken. Use the leftovers on mashed potatoes or simply freeze for another time.

5019266~Roasted Jalapeño-Tomato Salsa with Fresh Cilantro~319~63~24~5~0~3750~0~"This is our salsa closest to the classic home-style Mexican salsa de molcajete that's made from roasted garlic and chiles pounded in a lava-rock mortar (molcajete) with roasted tomatoes. Even though we've updated the equipment for the modern American kitchen, that perfect blend of sweetness (roasted garlic and tomatoes) and raciness (roasted jalapeños) is what you'll spoon out. The final addition of fresh cilantro and a drizzle of vinegar focuses the whole experience: This is just what most Americans wish they were getting when they open a jar with that ubiquitous ""salsa"" label. Made with plum tomatoes, your salsa will have a more homogenous texture — just right for using the salsa as an ingredient in other dishes. Because round tomatoes give a looser texture, choose them when you want a condiment to set on the table."

5019272~Strawberry Red-Currant Parfait~1453~151~126~21~84~335~302~This sophisticated blend of strawberries, red-currant jelly, balsamic vinegar, and bay leaves may just replace chocolate sauce as your favorite ice cream topping.
5019273~Soy-Basted Chicken Kebabs With Sesame-Citrus Sprinkle~1015~13~0~106~58~473~505~Soy adds saltiness along with a deep color to these skewers; the glaze would also be great on short ribs.

5019289~Prosciutto Rolls with Arugula and Figs~1420~76~60~62~101~2573~208~Prosciutto slices are usually paper-thin-but for this dish be sure they are not too thin or they will tear when you spread the cheese on them. Serve these with the Black Pepper Almonds, and pour Champagne.

This savory twist embellishes the dough with Parmesan cheese, the jam in question made with tomato and tart cherries. The jam recipe makes more than is needed for this batch of cookies, but it's not practical to make in smaller quantities. Extra will keep well in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Spread it on turkey or ham sandwiches, slather it on chicken breasts before baking, or serve as an accompaniment to cheese. You can use dried cranberries in place of the dried tart cherries, if you like.
5019294~Spiced Waffles with Caramelized Apples~1474~134~134~27~35~1561~67~Without the ice cream and served warm, these make a great brunch dish.

The sauce below is the answer I came up with. I replaced beef with veal; eliminated the milk, the wine, the carrot, and the celery; and reduced the cooking time from several hours to half of one. It is as easy to take as it is to do. Is it a favorite dish? Sure — it is my favorite simple meat sauce.

5019329~Mesclun Salad with Goat Cheese-Stuffed Figs Wrapped in Bacon~1232~108~90~37~73~2526~117~"The aged goat cheese called for in this recipe is firmer than fresh and has a dry rind. Two kinds work best in this dish, Bucheron and Pouligny-St.-Pierre, both of which have just the right amount of tang — but ask at the cheese counter for comparable substitutes if you have trouble finding them. Cafe Pasqual's, in Santa Fe, serves its version of this dish — ""pigs 'n' figs"" — with blue cheese."
5019330~Chestnut and Wild Mushroom Stuffing~2615~309~53~31~152~11219~623~This recipe was created by chef Traci Des Jardins of San Francisco's Jardinière. It's part of a special menu she created for Epicurious's Wine.Dine.Donate program.

The recipe can easily be adjusted to suit any party need: Make this single layer cake for birthdays, bake it as a sheet cake for backyard barbecues, or as a double-layer cake for even bigger celebrations.
5019333~German-Style Fried Potatoes~7992~1398~303~139~183~40705~68~Boiling the potatoes and chilling them overnight makes them easy to cut and sauté. Leftover potatoes and brisket would make a great breakfast hash.
5019334~Shiitake-Crusted Chicken with Creamed Mushrooms~1239~28~6~35~98~2746~246~Highly recommended!
5019335~Potato Salad with Pancetta, Rosemary, and Lemon~5004~1051~208~100~25~30371~0~Lemon peel and lemon juice, rosemary, and an olive oil dressing give this a nice lightness. If you prefer a creamy potato salad, use 2/3 cup mayonnaise in place of the olive oil.
5019336~Grilled Cheddar Cheese and Ham Sandwiches~1827~83~25~97~130~4325~434~Highly recommended!
5019337~Carrot Soup~3107~336~64~221~49~188757~78~Root vegetables are a staple of Irish cooking. They often show up in soups, such as this one from The Courtyard in Schull, Ireland.

5019341~Taglierini with Caramelized Scallops and Rosemary Beurre Blanc~1394~30~4~108~81~1880~368~The delicate 1/16-inch-wide pasta ribbons known as taglierini or tagliolini are the perfect foil for scallops and this elegant-and easy-sauce.
5019342~Herb and Cheese Pie~2202~130~11~43~121~3415~603~This fennel-and-scallion-enriched version of tyropita (Greek cheese pie) uses feta and cottage cheese to create a filling that's mildly tangy yet mellow.
5019344~Grilled Monterey Sardines with Lemon and Herbs~120~7~4~10~4~3027~27~Fresh sardines are widely available in California, but can be more difficult to find in the rest of the country. If fresh sardines are not available in your area, you can make a terrific spread with canned sardines.
5019345~Peach and Mascarpone Cheesecake with Balsamic Syrup~2919~438~343~25~118~644~653~Highly recommended!
5019346~Root Vegetable Gratin with Blue Cheese~3792~255~94~55~256~3647~967~We prefer Gorgonzola, Italy's star blue cheese, for this recipe, but if Iowa's Maytag blue — or another import — is easier to find in your area, then use it instead.

Next, marinate the turkey with the spices and yogurt in an oven roasting bag overnight. Then roast the turkey in the bag to lock in flavors and keep the meat ultra juicy. You'll have plenty of richly spiced gravy to pass around the table.
5019350~Fried Chick-Pea Sandwiches with Coriander Yogurt~766~79~17~33~49~2419~43~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5019351~Baked Chicken and Bacon-Wrapped Lady Apples~2352~356~241~60~73~3109~235~The ingredients are simple, but they add up to a main course that's incredibly hearty and satisfying. Cute little lady apples, cooked until soft and almost bursting, bring a luscious sweetness to the chicken and bacon.

5019354~Red Lentil Soup with Garam Masala~1683~350~43~170~29~4604~0~"Garam means ""hot"" and masala means ""spiced,"" though the mixture is not chili-hot. Instead the classic garam masala spices called for in the recipe-cardamom, cloves, black pepper, cumin, and cinnamon-are warmly aromatic."

5019357~Rustic Nut Bars~6439~499~281~182~453~3109~43~The richness of almonds, hazelnuts, cashews, and pistachios embodies the generosity of the season. A kiss of honey and brown sugar adds a sweet touch.

5019359~Pistachio-Crusted Chicken with Carrot Raita~448~50~9~17~16~1500~73~The Indian-spiced yogurt raita does double-duty, flavoring the chicken and serving as a dipping sauce.

5019365~Tuna Steak and Vegetable Sandwiches~1136~183~29~41~18~2023~101~Eggplant, zucchini, bell pepper and arugula share the stage with slices of tuna steak in the Mediterranean-inspired sandwich. Spoon the lentil salad alongside and offer chilled beer. Fresh pears and crisp biscotti round things out nicely.
5019366~Spiced Hazelnut-Pear Cake With Chocolate Sauce~7566~905~505~169~433~8538~1293~Capture the holiday spirit with this warm spiced cake, packed with nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. Wine-infused pears add a richness to the cake and are a pretty finishing touch.

5019374~Herb-Rubbed Turkey with Roasted-Garlic Gravy~479~102~9~14~1~2624~0~Contrary to popular opinion, Thanksgiving turkey, when not butter-basted, can be a healthful centerpiece to the meal. It's a superb source of lean protein, B vitamins, magnesium, and potassium. To add flavor without adding fat, this recipe uses a garlic-herb rub and a small amount of grapeseed oil, which raises good cholesterol. Another calorie-saving trick: In the gravy, roasted garlic replaces most of the fat from the drippings.
5019375~Grilled Chicken with Mustard-Dill Sauce~459~28~16~21~28~2095~69~Two mustards mellowed with honey and yogurt make a terrific sauce for chicken — or even fish or pork. This is an ideal warm-weather dish because the sauce does't require cooking.
5019376~Pork Braised with Autumn Vegetables~1128~124~36~28~54~2188~148~Pre-marinated pork tenderloins can be found in the supermarket meat section.

5019385~Baked Stuffed Mushrooms with Crab~699~8~3~120~20~4321~869~These crab-stuffed mushrooms are a longtime favorite at Phillips. Tip: Use a melon baller to scoop out the mushroom stems.
5019386~Fresh Fig Tart with Rosemary Cornmeal Crust and Lemon Mascarpone Cream~2297~345~111~83~108~704~295~Highly recommended!

5019388~Wild-Mushroom Bundles~759~27~1~5~58~2210~158~Sturdy forest-green collards provide the wrapping for buttery, juicy mushrooms. Elegance comes easily when it comes to these bundles, since they can be assembled a day ahead.
5019389~Easy Corn Bread~2234~341~56~46~70~3114~177~Highly recommended!
5019390~Honey-Ginger Salmon~438~109~105~0~0~905~0~At Lantana's, the salmon is served with spiced banana fritters.
5019391~Corn-Bread and Chorizo Stuffing~832~30~11~27~62~2144~77~What started as an arepa recipe evolved into a play on traditional American corn-bread stuffing. Chorizo takes the place of fresh sausage, and garlic adds punch to a buttery base. Imagine all of the classic textures with Latino flavorsits that good.
5019392~Beer-Can Cabbage Sandwiches~1961~173~74~50~123~3445~170~Beer-Can Chicken, step aside. Cabbage becomes the star of any backyard barbecue with this awesome beer-steaming–plus–grilling technique. Slathering the cabbage with barbecue sauce during cooking gives it a smoky, sweet flavor. Top with rich cheddar cheese, fresh slaw, and spicy pickled jalapeños and you'll never miss the meat in this hearty vegetarian sandwich.
5019393~Papaya-Pineapple Smoothie~1988~566~306~1~0~336~0~Highly recommended!
5019394~Chocolate Cake with Mascarpone and Praline~4435~445~251~116~287~1911~458~Highly recommended!
5019395~Mustard Chicken and Orzo Casserole with Dill and Capers~1987~207~12~41~117~5445~329~Active time: 45 min Start to finish: 1 3/4 hr
5019396~Simple Chicken Curry~1528~252~147~23~43~3129~76~Diced apple, dried apricots and golden raisins accent this 30-minute entrée.
5019397~Meat Loaf With Mushroom Gravy~3764~295~32~245~179~2309~1220~My mom's meat loaf is inarguably better than yours, but this is not my mom's meat loaf recipe. This one is an amalgam, intended to evoke all the important meat loaves in my life—and there have been many: The meat loaf I'd get at the family table as a child; the meat loaf I'd find (if I was lucky) in the steam table in the school cafeteria, usually festering in a pool of graying commercial gravy (God, I loved that stuff—especially when stoned); the meat loaf in the familiar foil tray of a Swanson TV dinner (which freed me from the oppression of a loving dinner table!); and the meat loaf my bosses insisted I keep on the menu at my first chef job—the restaurant failed, but the meat loaf was quite good. This, then is the sum of all those experiences.
5019398~Chicken Sausage~1777~96~21~106~106~14812~422~This sausage uses chicken and schmaltz, along with plentiful sage, garlic, ginger and pepper. And salt of course—sausage needs salt. My optimal salt level is 1.75 percent, so I multiply the weight of the meat (in ounces or grams) by 0.0175 to get that amount of the salt needed (also in ounces or grams). If you like less salt take it back to 1.5%.
5019399~Quinoa, Garbanzo, and Spinach Salad with Smoked Paprika Dressing~4198~503~143~120~200~6467~251~Fresh and colorful, this vegetarian entrée is an ideal bring-along for a potluck supper. Quinoa, a delicate grain with a texture similar to that of couscous, cooks up in just 15 minutes. A complete protein, it's also nutritious. Look for it at supermarkets and natural foods stores. Smoked paprika can be found in the spice section of the supermarket.
5019400~Chocolate Angel Food Cake with Fruit and Maple Yogurt~3562~880~673~83~11~845~13~Healthy bonus: 1 serving of fruit per slice, protein and riboflavin from eggs, calcium from yogurt, fiber, and nearly 1/3 of the RDA for vitamin C from berries
5019401~Arizona Cheese Strata~2731~260~56~110~131~6345~651~Highly recommended!
5019402~Tomato and Tapenade Tartlets~1611~52~3~99~100~2388~181~When tomatoes are at their peak, I could eat them three times a day and straight from the vine. But every once in a while, it's nice to give them a little special attention. When that time comes, this is the recipe I turn to. It's a tartlet that looks like it takes all day to make, but is really a quickie. It's warmed in the oven for such a short time that the tomatoes never lose their fresh-picked taste and texture. I serve these as a first course at dinner or with a salad as the main event at lunch.
5019403~Muffuletta Sandwich~1113~74~4~36~77~3677~79~Highly recommended!
5019404~Green Melon, Cubanelle Peppers and Ricotta Salata~645~93~73~21~20~2753~61~This salad of melon, sweet pepper, salty cheese and earthy basil recalls the watermelon salad that we all love so much, but its elegant components make it more refined. Salt is key to marrying the flavors, so be generous, tasting as you go. Be liberal, too, with a very good extra-virgin olive oil—it is very much a part of this salad.
5019405~Middle Eastern Chicken~372~47~5~25~6~4633~49~Highly recommended!
5019406~Lamb Chops with Everything-Bagel Yogurt and Chickpeas~1561~109~31~13~120~6905~7~Splurge on lamb rib chops or save on loin chops; either way you will enjoy this Moroccan-inspired meal. The familiar flavors of an everything bagel make a surprise appearance here to spice a zesty yogurt dip. Harissa paste (available in specialty food stores and many grocery stores) adds a fiery punch to chickpeas simmered with carrots and tomatoes. It can vary greatly in spiciness and saltiness from brand to brand, so add a little at first and taste as you go.
5019407~Chicken Breasts with Rock-Shrimp Sauce~943~11~5~18~78~3786~123~"Pair this surf-and-turf dish with white rice to soak up the delicious rock-shrimp sauce — a quick and easy variation on Marcella Hazan's pink shrimp sauce (from ""Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking""), which she serves over pasta."
5019408~Roast Chicken with Cumin, Paprika and Allspice~563~6~3~0~57~1769~0~Renee brings the flavors of the Middle East to her special Friday-night chicken. Roast chunks of butternut squash and potatoes alongside to cook the whole meal at once. Look for roasting chickens next to the fryers.
5019409~Poached Pear Tart with Caramelized Pistachios~8145~1436~593~135~193~2060~453~Highly recommended!
5019410~Cinnamon Flan~738~174~171~34~21~652~412~Make these a day ahead to give the caramel time to soften and the custards time to set.
5019411~Grilled Italian Sausage with Warm Pepper and Onion Salad~702~12~5~18~68~1802~64~Luganega, a coiled slender Italian pork sausage sold at Italian markets and some supermarkets, often comes with flavorings such as spices and cheese. If you can't find it, substitute any fresh Italian sausage.
5019412~Imperial Fizz~347~111~5~2~0~274~0~Highly recommended!
5019413~Skillet Choucroute with Potatoes~1887~391~169~33~18~16692~9~Sprinkle caraway seeds into tomato soup to begin the meal. Serve assorted mustards and pumpernickel bread with the choucroute, an Alsatian dish of sauerkraut and sausage. Then enjoy another flavor from Alsace: kirsch (clear cherry brandy), drizzled over cherry ice cream.
5019414~Shakshuka~949~94~50~17~54~9680~370~In Israel the word shakshuka is synonymous with breakfast. It's best with a slice or two of challah bread to sop up the juices. This is a version of my dad's recipe, except that he used to mix the eggs together, because my older sister refused to eat the egg whites. Here is the recipe I prefer.
5019415~Arugula and Prosciutto Tortilla Pizzas~553~14~7~2~58~918~0~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5019417~Celery Root, Carrot and Beet Salad~2212~226~79~31~126~2512~0~Highly recommended!

5019420~Beet and Jícama on Endive with Garlic Yogurt Dressing~1322~217~172~38~27~2499~35~Highly recommended!
5019421~Buttery Barley Risotto with Parmesan Cheese~2460~419~11~100~45~7537~118~In this recipe from Rick Tramonto, chef at Tru in Chicago, chewy pearl barley meets silky European butter in an outstanding alternative to arborio rice risotto. For best results, use Parmigiano-Reggiano.
5019422~Roasted Wild Mushrooms in Red-Wine Reduction~1394~42~6~1~133~1938~0~If you can't find fresh porcini mushrooms, buy whole frozen ones, defrost them in the fridge, and drain them on paper towels. Then roast them, uncovered, until tender and golden brown (and for about half the time as the fresh ones). As a last resort, other exotic fresh mushrooms mixed with reconstituted dried porcini would provide the body and flavor the dish needs. (Avoid dried porcini that are broken up.) Pair this dish with a few risotto cakes to make a main course.
5019423~"""Route 66"" Chili"~5557~43~10~389~409~24326~1457~Highly recommended!

5019426~Earl Grey Tea Ice Cream~2510~205~202~16~196~1556~661~When we added Earl Grey ice cream to our trucks' offerings in 2009, New Yorkers went mad for it. Not surprisingly—black tea, combined with bergamot oil, cuts through the summer heat about as well as anything. We use a high-quality loose tea from our favorite tea brand, Rishi, which uses pure Italian bergamot citrus oil (and not bergamot flavoring), to make the most intensely fragrant Earl Grey tea ice cream.
5019427~Garlic Ancho Chile Jam~679~71~35~0~41~818~0~Highly recommended!
5019428~Squash Custard Pie~279~36~11~22~10~154~370~This pie is best made with freshly cooked kuri squash purée.
5019429~Roasted Bell Pepper Salad with Pine Nuts~2103~95~7~23~192~1411~0~Highly recommended!
5019430~Avocado Sour Cream Mousse~654~26~13~22~53~2446~0~We call for California avocados in our recipes because our food editors prefer their rich flavor and creamy texture to that of West Indian avocados, which tend to taste a bit bland and watery.
5019431~Shrimp Creole Risotto~5100~552~40~72~241~6175~457~This recipe was created by chefs Slade Rushing and Allison Vines-Rushing of the Longbranch in Abita Springs, Louisiana. It's part of a special menu they created for Epicurious's Wine.Dine.Donate program.

5019443~Hanger Steak with Shallots and Jerusalem Artichokes~1725~94~50~0~147~2042~152~The vinegared shallots and fresh herbs cut through the richness of the steak.
5019444~Lentil Soup with Roasted Vegetables~1060~143~15~22~41~2722~4~Highly recommended!
5019445~Absinthe's Golden Yogurt Cake~3875~511~360~87~231~1717~714~This moist, simple cake has a tender golden crumb and a subtle citrus flavor. I love a thin slice—okay, a thick slice—in the middle of the afternoon with coffee, but it's also well matched with summer berries and stone fruits. My husband enjoys it for breakfast. Accompany the cake and fruit with a dollop of the Yogurt Cream, if you like. In winter, pair the cake with a citrus compote or poached quince.

5019447~Squid and Fennel Pasta with Lemon and Herbs~3186~300~9~108~179~3747~122~On a warm, sunny day, pasta calls for fresh seafood, a big handful of herbs, and punchy lemon. All that's missing is the beach house

There he was treated to the most exquisite salad he'd ever had. Although the restaurant calls it Fall Salad on the menu, it's enjoyable year-round.
5019454~Hoffman House (or Astoria)~259~86~0~0~0~0~0~Highly recommended!
5019455~Butternut Squash Galette~1966~142~9~94~155~3055~337~The delicate crust of this galette gets a warm spiciness from fresh sage.

5019461~Salmon Trout Poached in White Wine~531~11~5~0~3~9258~0~Forget gefilte fish and try this instead: a version of a French classic called carpe à la juive. (It calls for salmon trout instead of carp.) The fish (opposite) is chilled overnight, so begin the recipe a day ahead. Pour a Riesling.
5019462~Baked Apples~1650~287~273~27~42~470~218~Active time: 15 min Start to finish: 1 1/2 hr
5019464~Spicy Chicken and Hominy Ragoût~403~37~3~21~15~1568~45~Reinforce the southwestern theme with accompaniments like corn bread and a spinach salad with grapefruit segments and toasted pine nuts.

The combination is used in sauces, vegetables, and meat dishes, but it also adds subtle freshness to green salads.
5019468~Chocolate Cake with Milk Chocolate-Peanut Butter Frosting and Peanut Butter Brittle~11888~2032~1413~142~393~6582~958~No, it's not a mistake. This cake really doesn't contain any eggs. The oil in the batter makes the cake moist; the rest of the ingredients provide enough structure to give the cake a great crumb.
5019470~Plum-Almond Tart~3125~452~185~40~126~195~351~Highly recommended!
5019472~Basic Tea Punch~3690~835~773~0~0~312~0~Highly recommended!

5019479~Planter's Punch III~467~89~81~2~14~0~0~This is the traditional planter's punch that follows the old rhyme: One of sour (lime juice), two of sweet (sugar), three of strong (rum), four of weak (ice or water).

5019484~Porcini-Crusted Beef Tenderloin with Truffle Butter Sauce~1224~49~9~33~104~2176~166~Mushrooms and beef have long been an inspired combination, and here they're joined in a particularly sophisticated way. Dried porcini mushrooms grind to a powder in no time in a blender and add a subtle woodsiness to the beef, while the truffle butter enriches the sauce with its heady aroma. Black-truffle butter is the best deal going. It gives you tremendous flavor at an affordable price, a fraction of the cost of a fresh black truffle.
5019485~Handmade Orecchiette With Mortadella and Pea Sauce~1970~129~60~42~137~986~631~This tiny handmade pasta is a labor of love, but you'll be glad you devoted an afternoon to fresh pasta-making once you've tasted it.

5019488~Steak with Olives~2559~33~0~186~140~490~690~Tender and flavorful, sirloin needs little adornment. The olive sauce imparts just the right hint of spice and saltiness—and it's ready in about ten minutes.
5019490~Hickory-Grilled Rib-Eye Steaks with Bacon-Molasses Butter~1248~0~0~49~133~2121~366~Sweet cherry tomatoes make an easy appetizer. What to drink: Top off glasses of cold lemonade with a splash of bourbon, and garnish with fresh mint sprigs. For wine drinkers, offer a California Pinot Noir.
5019491~Pomegranate-Ginger Champagne Cocktail~321~79~72~0~0~26~0~Look for pomegranate juice in the juice aisle or fresh juice section of the supermarket.
5019492~Black-Bean Tostados with Roasted Tomatillo Sauce~2301~154~22~74~150~6599~236~It's the spicy, garlicky tomatillo salsa that really sells these addictive tostadas. Frying store-bought corn tortillas heightens the vibrancy of their corn flavor and creates a crisp foundation for the refried black beans, shredded romaine, lush avocado, and creamy queso fresco.
5019493~Chief of Staff Cholent (Hebronite Hamim)~2789~518~157~70~46~5241~370~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are excerpted from Joan Nathan's book The Foods of Israel Today.

5019498~Spicy Broccoli Rabe~547~64~6~17~19~2313~31~Highly recommended!
5019499~Chopped Arabic Salad~1043~82~6~0~71~2270~0~This salad is wonderfully refreshing even without purslane, but if you can find the green at your produce market, it's worth using for the nice crunch it adds.
5019500~Sesame Chicken Drumettes~637~69~25~20~26~3521~62~Highly recommended!
5019501~Lemon and Fresh Herb Tabbouleh~880~137~8~15~28~495~0~We've been making tabbouleh for years, but when Fran's Iranian friend Parvine Latimore made it for a special party, we both changed our recipes. Parvine used extra lemon juice and more fresh herbs than we were used to. The result was incredible—a delicious taste of lemon with every bite of grain and a burst of freshness from the blend of fresh herbs with every mouthful.
5019502~Spinach and Roasted Beet Salad with Ginger Vinaigrette~784~78~8~45~29~2171~0~The lively dressing lends a little zip to this fresh-tasting, colorful salad.

5019504~Chive Dressing~453~40~1~23~11~1115~0~Use this versatile sauce as a dip for crudités, a dressing for cold fish or chicken, and as a substitute for mayonnaise. Tofu makes it virtually fat-free.
5019505~Roast Prime Ribs of Beef with Shiitake Pan Gravy~1872~134~54~50~130~41214~261~Highly recommended!
5019507~Habanero-Marinated Pork Chops With Mustard Greens Slaw~1088~137~87~25~44~3626~69~One citrusy, chile-laced, and very hard-working marinade serves two functions, flavoring the pork chops before and after they hit the grill.
5019508~Whipped Ricotta with Honey and Mixed Berries~2070~264~209~47~90~964~339~Cream cheese was added to the ricotta for this smooth, luscious dessert. But if you can find fresh ricotta, which is less grainy than some of the commercial types, use it and omit the cream cheese.
5019509~Banana Cupcakes with Peanut Butter Frosting~5783~788~554~79~260~2506~514~A classic combination in an adorable little package. The cupcakes, which are reminiscent of banana bread, would be a great breakfast treat (with or without the frosting).
5019510~Picadillo Arepa Pie~1971~127~46~109~118~3411~513~Versions of picadillo—a savory dish of beef, onion, and tomato punctuated by olives and raisins—are served in many Latin American countries. Crowned with a tender biscuit topping made with arepa flour, it becomes a homey one-dish dinner.
5019511~Chicken Breasts with Tomato-Herb Pan Sauce~623~56~14~23~26~189824~112~The key to this sauté: Cook the tomatoes with the bits of chicken left over after you've seared it in the pan. When the tomatoes burst, swirl in the remaining marjoram butter to finish the pan sauce.
5019512~Sunday Sauce With Braciole, Meatballs, and Sausage~5159~503~75~277~215~13344~942~No crowd to feed? No problem. Sunday Sauce freezes well; just make sure any braciole, meatballs, or sausages are submerged in sauce.
5019513~Food Processor Pizza Dough~12~1~0~1~0~969~0~"This simple pizza dough comes together quickly and is perfect for a thin crust pizza like ""Trenton Tomato Pie"" Pizza. The overnight rest is key for texture and flavor development."
5019516~Creamy Farfalle with Salmon and Peas~1776~198~53~146~47~2874~341~This dish only looks indulgent: A serving has a mere 7 grams of saturated fat, and the pasta and peas help deliver 40 percent of your daily intake of folate, a nutrient that aids the body in forming red blood cells.
5019517~Marinated Eggplant with Capers and Mint~892~64~16~5~71~235~0~Sliced thin and broiled, eggplant retains a slight chewiness but still melts in the mouth; a caper and mint vinaigrette brightens everything.

5019524~Broccoli Slaw with Miso-Ginger Dressing~928~124~57~12~32~596~10~Broccoli slaw doesn't have to be the dried-out stuff you find pre-sliced at the grocery store. Instead, we've grated the stems and chopped the florets for a nice combo of textures. The Asian-inspired flavors in this mix can add bright tang as a side to any meal.
5019525~Tomato, Arugula, and Ricotta Salata Salad~345~10~13~22~20~25659~61~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5019532~Roasted Beet Soup with Potato and Dill Salad~2029~377~155~52~25~10162~74~Highly recommended!
5019533~Apricot Frozen Yogurt~2957~748~527~27~0~409~0~We highly recommend using California apricots for this recipe —their intense flavor and color give this frozen yogurt a real boost that's missing when it's made with the Turkish variety.
5019534~Pasta with Chicken, Curly Endive, and Blue Cheese~4645~370~69~183~268~8883~391~Highly recommended!

5019541~Grilled Turmeric and Lemongrass Chicken Wings~3492~64~23~255~222~8081~1035~Cooking the wings slowly over medium-low coals and turning them often makes for crisp results; the skin will brown while the meat cooks through. Be sure to begin 1 day ahead; the chicken needs to marinate overnight for the flavors to infuse.
5019542~Strawberry Buckle with Lemon-Pistachio Streusel~4014~517~311~99~236~4381~907~"James is very proud to have a pastry department at Blue Bottle Coffee. He loves that making our own food gives us control over the customer's entire experience. He has made a big deal about not having what he calls a PBM (perfunctory bran muffin) on his shelves. Well, it turns out that many people really like to have a muffin for breakfast, and customers who came in expecting to find one in the pastry case were disappointed that we didn't have anything resembling a muffin. Knowing full well that ""muffin"" is a euphemism for ""cake for breakfast,"" I decided not to hide it—I developed a buttery, fruit-based cake that we serve in an elegant paper cup."

5019546~Peas and Potatoes Masala~541~29~14~19~38~1359~0~Round this out with warm pita bread, rice and carrot pilaf, and some plain yogurt. Mint tea and pistachio baklava are a great finish.
5019547~Coconut-Piloncillo Ice Cream with Coconut Tortilla Chips and Fruit Salsa~611~81~51~23~16~706~8~Wrap the piloncillo, Mexican brown sugar cones, in a kitchen towel and crush with a hammer to fine crumbs. If you can't find piloncillo, feel free to substitute packed dark brown sugar. Because coconut milk is not a dairy product, this delicious dessert is pareve.
5019548~Chicken and Broccoli Alfredo~2733~74~28~221~179~7707~525~Highly recommended!
5019549~Ruffled Pasta with Herbed Ricotta and Pine Nut Brown Butter~552~0~0~0~61~969~94~Mafalde, similar to dried lasagne noodles but not nearly as wide, work well in this dish, as do campanelle, the bellflower-shaped pasta shells.

5019553~Mashed Potato and Vegetable Patties with Ginger-Cilantro Chutney~372~30~12~19~17~3674~370~These showcase all that's great about Indian food: They're vibrant, light, and fragrant. For a spicier patty, add a second stemmed and minced serrano chile.
5019555~Turkey Piccata with Tarragon Cream~1160~3~2~25~105~954~368~Highly recommended!
5019556~Cucumbers and Dill in Horseradish Cream~71~2~0~6~6~1772~15~Highly recommended!

5019562~English Chocolate Trifle with Apricots and Raspberries~6841~781~491~87~390~2348~999~A trifle with a few twists: a white chocolate pudding and layers of dark chocolate cream and apricot puree.
5019563~Blueberry Sour Cream Pie~3181~644~304~60~39~993~4~The almond-scented blueberry filling is sprinkled with a pecan topping.

5019565~Spicy Shrimp Rémoulade on Molasses-Buttered Toast~2143~93~34~52~170~2530~874~Chilled shrimp in piquant remoulade sauce is a Creole classic. Here, it tops pumpernickel toasts spread with a chili-molasses butter. What to drink: Berry Rum Punch.
5019566~Pine Nut Torta with Marsala-Poached Autumn Fruit~8141~1393~737~102~240~1322~324~Tuscan sweets tend to be simple and rustic, like this deliciously buttery, moist cake, similar in texture to marzipan. What to drink: Tuscany's famous Vin Santo, a dessert wine made from raisined grapes.
5019567~Pumpkin-Apple Streusel Cake~6961~1456~461~142~44~2423~464~This easy-to-make dessert tastes like pumpkin spice cake and apple crisp baked together.

The swank venue features a stage surrounded by tables where you can spy toe-tapping regulars such as Nicolette Sheridan and Virginia Madsen taking in the soulful jazz tunes. You can make a meal of chef Sharon Funt's delicious flatbread appetizer; each serving provides more than 8 grams of fiber.
5019571~Tartar Sauce~1647~24~5~2~176~2240~281~This recipe originally accompanied Ale-Battered Shrimp with Tartar Sauce .
5019573~Tuna Salad on Olive Bread with Arugula~1244~32~8~9~126~3046~189~Complete this one with cherry tomatoes, potato chips, and lemonade.
5019574~Rhubarb with Berries and Candied Ginger~1945~446~412~4~0~381~0~Highly recommended!

5019579~Smoked Pork Chops with Pineapple-Rosemary Sauce~826~46~11~21~58~58~69~We don't recommend doubling the sauce ingredients if you're cooking for more than two people — the sauce will lose its intensity. Instead, you may want to make two batches.
5019580~Mint Chocolate Chip Ice-Milk Sandwiches~2235~423~279~57~56~1296~76~Highly recommended!
5019581~Corn Bread with Tomato Chutney~1149~299~42~100~12~8397~28~My friend Marvin Woods taught me everything I know about Low-Country cooking, the regional cuisine commonly referred to as soul food. In many ways, soul food is an apt description because there is a lot of soul and spirit and passion that goes into Low-Country cooking—dishes like she-crab soup, catfish stew, shrimp and grits, red rice, hoppin' John, and baked macaroni and cheese. No Low-Country feast would be complete without corn bread.

5019637~Almond Cream Cheese Frosting~2623~618~592~4~12~101~93~"""I've always loved to cook and bake,"" writes Gert Schwartz of Skokie, Illinois. ""When my husband worked for the kitchens of Sara Lee, I would bake about 2,000 cookies each Christmas to send to his coworkers. People thought it strange — sending coals to Newcastle — but at that time Sara Lee did not make cookies (I wasn't about to compete with the cheesecake operation), and everyone seemed to enjoy them. In your January 2001 issue, I read about the different cakes and had a desire to try the devil's food one, since my husband loves chocolate. I made the recipe as 24 cupcakes and decided to use a frosting recipe I have had since I was married, over 50 years ago. As a little girl, my favorite birthday cake was chocolate with white frosting, and when I took my first bite of your recipe, there I was: ten years old again. I thought you might like to have that frosting recipe."""

I first became interested in cooking when my son, Paul, was growing up. He was a picky eater and quite a challenge to cook for. He's married now with children of his own, and thankfully, he has learned to love almost everything I make. When we all get together, I like to do the cooking — it gives my daughter-in-law a break. And because most of my recipes are speedy, I still have time to enjoy my three grandchildren."""

My mom started it off by cutting the kernels off the cobs, simmering the corncobs in the stock, and then scraping the cobs to capture every ounce of delicious corn flavor. Her friend Darryle Pollack taught her the trick of including potatoes and blending part of the soup to thicken it. I added warming spices like paprika and cayenne pepper to complement the sweetness of the summer corn and topped it with charred red bell peppers. Together we created a perfect soup. —Marea

Tuna noodle was the hands-down family favorite, which was a boon to my mother because she could make everyone happy with the contents of two cans (tuna and soup) and a partial box of egg noodles. When I'm feeling nostalgic, I make it for my own family. I have to admit I now prepare it with my own sauce, embellishing it with extra mushrooms and a little Sherry for flavor.

5019720~Pappadams (Lentil Wafers)~10137~0~0~0~1182~0~0~In North India these legume wafers are called papad and are dry-roasted over a flame, but in the South they are deep-fried until they form lots of air bubbles and become light and puffy. They are sold in many flavors, but plain is preferred in Kerala. Pappadams are always part of a Sadhya: You crush one up and mix it together with rice, dhal, and ghee. The pappadam helps to bind all the ingredients together so you can form balls when eating with your hand. Store-bought wafers are used almost exclusively by Indian cooks because the traditional recipes are labor-intensive and require days of drying in the hot sun. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.

5019752~Grilled Poussins with Lemon Herb Butter~1080~7~3~0~114~7762~214~This is the ideal way to prepare young chickens, since there are two safeguards against their drying out (always a risk with small birds). The herbed butter slipped beneath the skin melts, basting and flavoring the meat as it cooks; the gentle, indirect heat lightly chars the skin without toughening the meat. As a result, every bite is juicy and perfectly seasoned.

5019759~A Simple Roast Turkey~842~28~13~13~73~21416~223~The first Thanksgiving I took part in cooking was when I was 20, a college kid in Boston, living in a big, rambling house. The apartment was a kind of clubhouse devoted to a shifting list of priorities that included music, books, girls, beer, and food. On Thanksgiving we cooked a turkey. The recipe was my pal John Patrick Montaño's, and I still use it today: a roast bird glazed with a rosemary-infused teriyaki butter. The piney herb melds beautifully with the butter and sweet caramel of the mirin browning on lacquered skin. At once familiar and exotic, it results in flavor of astonishing depth.

5019781~Stuffed Dates~2225~154~108~51~160~0~0~Dates are revered, and much enjoyed, in Morocco. Of the more than two hundred varieties that the country produces, large mejhoul dates are the ones used for special occasions and special recipes like these stuffed dates. Typically, the almond paste is much sweeter than in this recipe, and the stuffed date is rolled in sugar. I prefer to let the dates' natural and intense sweetness shine.
5019782~Carrot-Orange Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting~14075~2328~1911~74~549~4851~876~Carrot cakes have been a part of American baking for years, and they remain a favorite dessert in the heartland.

5019787~Sweet Potato Wedges with Lime Mayo~607~74~14~7~30~2222~0~This zesty mayo dip would also go well with sliced red bell peppers and celery sticks before dinner; it's amazing how many vegetables kids will eat when they're actually hungry.

5019790~Rosemary Garlic Potato Bread~5960~1262~43~348~62~6099~0~I learned the joys of putting potatoes in bread during my time in the Napa Valley, so the flavors here are resonant of that magical place, but don't be afraid to change up the herbs or play with nuts and olives. You can't mess it up. Well, you can—I certainly have more than once—but you know what I mean. You can do this by hand, but it's messy, so I wrote this recipe with directions for using a stand mixer. —Duff

5019798~Hot Sauce Brown Butter~443~2~2~0~47~641~126~In addition to looking at the color of the liquid butter as it cooks, keep your eyes trained on the solids; the butter is ready when the bits are very dark brown.

5019804~Wine-Braised Brisket With Butternut Squash~1339~189~88~59~40~9637~66~Brisket really  gets Jews talking. The mere mention of the word brings up stories of holidays past, aunts who can’t cook, aunts who can cook, grandmas force-feeding grandkids, etc. While beef was often very expensive in the old country, brisket became a symbol of plenty in North America, where it was more affordable but no less special. This brisket is braised for hours, just as many Jewish briskets are, but we incorporate white wine instead of the more typical red, and butternut squash instead of potatoes. This makes for a lighter, brighter brisket, if such a thing exists, so it’s a better fit for holiday meals served during the warmer months. Note that the second cut brisket we recommend for this recipe will not slice as thinly as the first cut. It’s softer and fattier. This doesn’t bother us. The meat will be so tender you could cut it with a spoon—who needs a thin slice? Also note that if you’d like to make this a more wintry brisket, you can swap the squash for potatoes and/or turnips and put the veggies in an hour earlier than the recipe calls for. Jeffrey prefers it that way, and once again, we agree to disagree.

His solution? Chopped lean meat, or hamburger steak. To hide the ""liver-y"" taste of hamburger, he recommended adding horseradish, mustard or Worcestershire sauce.

5020026~Pine Nut and Fruit Ice Cream Sundaes~1770~221~159~17~103~71~127~Arlene sometimes uses sliced apricots, peaches or whole strawberries instead of plums for an equally delicious topping.

5020031~Hot Chicken Salad~3395~66~17~156~281~6942~686~This hot chicken casserole is perfectly seasoned. Lots of celery and almonds give it a nice crunch. You may be inclined to leave off the potato-chip topping, but believe me, it won't be the same without it!
5020032~Chocolate Chunks with Cherries and Pistachios~4082~478~348~72~236~1333~175~You thought chocolate was good? Try chocolate with cherries and pistachios. Heaven!
5020033~Chicken Tetrazzini~4215~231~53~202~281~12598~1273~We used grocery rotisserie chickens for this recipe, but leftover turkey from the holiday table works equally well.

5020039~Roasted Spring Vegetables~403~33~0~0~27~0~0~High-heat roasting concentrates vegetables' flavor and brings out their sweetness— a big reward for little effort. Use this recipe as a template. Most important: Cut into similar-size pieces, and don't overcrowd the pan.

5020044~Pork Confit~6591~48~9~519~447~35544~1943~Start the confit at least two weeks ahead. This would also be delicious on its own served with mashed potatoes.

5020064~Green Salad with Orange, Fennel, and Asparagus~1132~41~26~10~110~1107~0~Look for tender greens, such as mâche, Boston, and red leaf lettuces, which appear in farmers' markets at this time of year. Or, as an alternative, use premixed baby greens.

5020077~Stuffed Onions with Spiced Lamb and Pomegranate~1584~209~43~59~52~7439~151~Menashe advises against overstuffing the onions with the filling; the rice expands, gradually increasing the size of the onions as they cook. Feel free to swap in ground beef for the lamb.
5020078~Spinach and Sorrel Spanakopita~2172~119~15~31~164~3049~241~Mixing sorrel with spinach makes an outstanding spanakopita, but the combination is nothing new. The Greeks have been doing it for a long time and it makes a lot of sense. The distinctive tang of sorrel not only replaces the lemon juice often found in spinach fillings for spanakopita, but it also balances the brininess of the feta.

5020082~Roasted and Raw Carrot Salad with Avocado and Toasted Cumin Vinaigrette~1199~44~24~19~113~615~0~I love using baby carrots in assorted colors. Thumbelina carrots, which are little and stubby, are great for roasting. I use red, orange, yellow, and white carrots for the ribbons, which make this salad so vibrant. Even just the orange variety next to the green of the avocado and mizuna makes a beautiful and colorful salad. Toasting whole cumin seeds and then grinding them in a mortar and pestle or an electric spice grinder is essential for the great taste of this vinaigrette. If you don't have either way of grinding spices, you can substitute cumin powder. This salad rocks from the contrast between the soft texture and caramelized sweetness of the roasted carrots and their raw and crunchy counterparts.
5020083~Cabbage Soup with Apples and Thyme~2146~388~271~34~52~13679~94~Thyme really shines in this soup; sautéed apples are an interesting sweet garnish.

True to their English heritage, the colonists planted kitchen gardens with as many herbs as they could cultivate, which they put into all kinds of dishes, including chowders.
5020099~Bacon-Wrapped Maple Pork Loin~1449~191~108~33~53~1514~115~Maple syrup brings out the subtle sweetness of the bacon. If you like, you can substitute molasses (not blackstrap).

5020110~Baked Ham with Marmalade-Horseradish Glaze~1677~424~366~7~0~198~0~Although labeled fully cooked, the ham will still need a gentle baking for maximum tenderness and flavor. Be sure the Cranberry Mustard and the Whole Wheat Date Rolls are close at hand and that the ham is sliced thin for those who would like to make small sandwiches.
